<h2>SCIENTIFIC METHOD AND ITS APPLICATION TO THE BIBLE.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By the Rev. DAVID SPRAGUE</span>, B. D.</p>


<p>"Trained and organized common sense" is Professor Huxley's
definition of science. There is probably no better.</p>

<p>The popular mind persists in thinking that there is a wide difference
between science and knowledge in general. Yes, there is
a wide difference, but it is just the difference that there is between
a trained and organized <i>body</i> of men for the accomplishing of some
great work, and a <i>crowd</i> of men unorganized and undisciplined.
What unscientific knowledge has accomplished may be roughly seen
in the condition of savage races to-day; while the changes wrought
by knowledge trained and organized, in enlarging the sum of knowledge,
in extending men's power of perception, and in increasing the
facilities not merely for living, but for living well, are changes in
comparison with which all others recorded in history are trifling.</p>

<p>It will be profitable for us, in order to get a clearer idea of scientific
method, to trace as briefly as possible the history of science
and the development of the scientific idea.</p>

<p>The very beginning of science is beyond our ken. We can form
no idea of just what stage in the intellectual development of the
race witnessed the rise of training and order in men's knowledge.
Long before the dawn of history there must have been some degree
of orderliness in men's knowledge&mdash;some grouping of facts, and reasoning
from one thing to another. Rude classification would be
made, e. g., among animals, as some were found to be good for
food and others not; so among herbs, as to size, form, color, use
for food and medicine, poisonous qualities, etc.; so among woods, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
some were better adapted than others to use as instruments of war
and of the chase. Men must also, very early in their development,
have noticed the changes that took place in the heavens: the sun
by day, the moon and the stars by night; have grouped the stars
into little clusters here and there as they seemed rudely to resemble
forms of things which they knew, and as some were brighter than
the rest; have begun to reckon periods of time according as position
of sun and moon varied. In their observation of the heavens no
other phenomenon would have attracted as much attention as an
eclipse, and for a long time men would have ascribed this occasional
phenomenon to the intervention of some supernatural power. In
process of time, however, as their observations were made with more
care and recorded, some regularity would be noticed in these, as in
other phenomena of the skies; and the period of their recurrence
being at last approximately known by those more learned than the
rest, predictions of eclipses would be made and verified by what would
seem to the multitude direct supernatural aid. Hence the earliest
scientific records that have come down to us are of eclipses observed,
and in time regularly predicted, by the Chaldeans; hence also the
reputation that was always given to the Chaldeans of having magical
power. Coming down now to the time when men first seemed to
have a genuine spirit of scientific inquiry, we find it among the
Greeks some five hundred years <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> Whatever of rudely scientific
work had been done before, seems to have been for practical
or religious purposes. About that time, however, men began to investigate
and speculate in order to find out the truth, and soon we see
a class of men, known as philosophers, whose one aim was to find
out, because they loved, the truth. "What they saw excited them
to meditate, to conjecture, and to reason; they endeavored to account
for natural events, to trace their causes, to reduce them to principles"
(Whewell). They set about this, too, in no small, narrow way.
They wanted to go right to the bottom of things, of everything at
once, and to know the great principles, as they called them, of
Nature and of life. That was the reason why the actual scientific
results of Greek thought, with all its splendid powers, were so meager.
Two things are the necessary conditions of science&mdash;facts, and the
human power of reasoning. Two processes must be carried out in
order to yield any scientific result: facts must be patiently accumulated,
and the mind must set its reasoning powers to work on them.
It was in the first of these that the Greeks were wanting. They did
not realize the need of endless patience in learning the details of
Nature's way of working. They wished to take in all of Nature
with one tremendous sweep of thought. They did a little investigating
and a great deal of reasoning. Occasionally, however, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
find an instance of inquiry into the cause of more definite and limited
phenomena, which seems much more to suggest the true spirit of
physical inquiry. We have one recorded by Herodotus, which is
the more remarkable from being so nearly alone. It is in reference
to the fact which he had observed about the flooding of the
Nile&mdash;that it was flooded for one hundred days, beginning with the
summer solstice; and that from that time it diminished, and was
during the winter months very low. He tells us that he made
pressing inquiries about the cause of it from many of the Egyptians,
but that he found no satisfaction, and apparently little interest in
the matter. Three different theories on the subject that had been
propounded by the Greeks he examines in detail and confutes; and
finally he states a theory of his own. And yet even in this instance
of scientific inquiry he commits the usual fault of the Greeks&mdash;he does
not pursue far enough the investigation of the facts of the case, and
the absence of the facts he tries to make up for by exhaustive arguments
on words used in describing the phenomena.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem at a first glance, it is a very similar
trouble that we find with the reasoning of Aristotle. It seems
strange, I say, because we are accustomed to associate with Aristotle
just those things which would seem to indicate a scientific temper,
and to give promise of great results: 1. Extensive accumulation of
facts. Many of those works of Aristotle which remain to us are
vast treasuries of facts collected from almost every field of Nature,
and we have reason for thinking that he made other wonderful collections
of facts which have not come down to us. His work has been a
standing marvel to all time. 2. Extraordinary powers of reasoning.
3. The fact that he asserted in the strongest terms the need of building
up the whole superstructure of knowledge on <i>experience</i>. And
yet throughout his works, side by side with the evidences of profound
knowledge and profound speculation, there are repeated instances
of reasonings which are not only unsound, but altogether
puerile&mdash;e. g., in the beginning of his treatise on the heavens he
proves the world to be perfect by reasoning of the following kind:
"The bodies of which the world is composed are solids, and therefore
have three dimensions. Now, three is the most perfect number; it
is the first of numbers, for of one we do not speak as a number;
of two we say both; but three is the first number of which we say
all; moreover, it has a beginning, a middle, and an end." That
is a fair instance of his scientific incompetency. He has the facts,
he is able to reason, but he does not reason <i>according to</i> the facts;
he loses sight of them and builds up great arguments on words and
names. To give one more example: "He is endeavoring to explain
the fact that when the sun's light passes through a hole, whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
be the form of the hole, the bright image, if formed at any considerable
distance from the hole, is circular. This, of course, is
easily seen to be a necessary consequence of the circular figure of
the sun, if we conceive light to be diffused from the luminary by
means of straight rays proceeding from every point. But Aristotle
attempts to explain the fact by saying that the sun's light has a
circular nature which it always tends to manifest. He employs the
vague and loose conception of a circular <i>quality</i> instead of the distinct
conception of rays" (Whewell).</p>

<p>It is a kind of reasoning which may be applied with great show
of success to everything, but which really proves nothing.</p>

<p>And so, as a matter of fact, Aristotle did not leave one single
scientific generalization of value to succeeding ages.</p>

<p>Did not the Greeks then do anything in the way of physical science
that was to stand? Yes, there was a little work that was exact,
and therefore lasting. Archimedes established the fundamental
principle on the one hand of the lever, on the other of pressure in
fluids&mdash;that is to say, laid the stable foundation of the sciences of
statics and hydrostatics. Euclid developed, if he did not discover,
the law of the reflection of light. Pythagoras discovered, and his
followers developed, some of the fundamental principles of harmonics.
Greater than any of the others in genuine scientific work
was Hipparchus, who, with many erroneous theories, yet really laid
the permanent foundation of the science of astronomy. Only one
more name need be mentioned among the ancients&mdash;that of Ptolemy,
who seemed possessed of a genuinely scientific spirit. He accomplished
little original work, made no broad generalization (what is
known as the Ptolemaic system was in reality the system of Hipparchus),
but more than any other of the ancients he is the type
of the true scientist in these respects&mdash;the accuracy of his observations,
the thoroughness of his work at every point, and the really
great additions that he made to science in the way of verifying,
correcting, and extending the theory he received. He lived in the
early part of the second century <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span></p>

<p>And the next name to attract our notice is that of Copernicus,
more than twelve hundred years later. What is the meaning of
that lapse of time? After such noble foundations had been laid,
was there no great scientific work built thereon in all those centuries?
Absolutely none. It will be well for us to think for a
moment of what were the reasons for that barrenness, for the same
causes are more or less at work at all times to hinder the growth
of science and the extension of scientific method.</p>

<p>1. And what strikes us most forcibly at the outset is a lack of
the sense of the importance of physical science. Through most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
that period Christianity dominated the best thought of Europe, and
the tremendous practical problems that confronted the Church for
a long time threw everything else into the shade; for a long time,
I said, during the early part of this period in especial, when the
Church in general seemed to realize its responsibility to win the
whole world to its Master, and every individual coming into the
Church was made to feel that the Church's work was above everything
else in the world. The importance of an exhaustive knowledge of
the facts of Nature seemed trifling when compared with questions
of character and future life, and making the world feel the power
of Christ. Eusebius only expressed the thought of much of his age
when he said, speaking of those who pursued the study of physical
science, "It is not through ignorance of the things admired by
them, but through contempt of their useless labor, that we think little
of these matters, turning our souls to the exercise of better things."
And with that deliberate turning away from such subjects there
would come of necessity that indistinctness of ideas about natural
things which is fatal to all scientific investigation. Witness these
words of Lactantius: "To search for the causes of natural things;
to inquire whether the sun be as large as he seems; whether the
moon is convex or concave; whether the stars are fixed in the sky
or float freely in the air; of what size and of what material are
the heavens, whether they be at rest or in motion; what is the magnitude
of the earth, on what foundations it is suspended and balanced&mdash;to
dispute and conjecture on such matters is just as if we
chose to discuss what we think of a city in a remote country, of
which we never heard but the name." As Whewell, from whom
these last two quotations are taken, says, "It is impossible to express
more forcibly that absence of any definite notions on physical
subjects which led to this tone of thought."</p>

<p>2. Contributing, without doubt, largely to that indistinctness of
ideas, and to the low value put upon physical science, was the mysticism
common to the early and the medi&aelig;val Church, and to the
world at large for many hundred years&mdash;the mysticism, that is to
say, the habit of assigning supernatural agencies to the various phenomena
of Nature, and of regarding them as subject to the vicissitudes
of arbitrary will rather than as following out the workings
of a consistent orderly plan. There is no need of any attempt to show
how fatal such a spirit is to science, nor how that spirit seemed for
a long while to dominate the world. "It changed physical science
to magic; astronomy to astrology; the study of the composition of
bodies to alchemy; and even mathematics was changed till it became
the contemplation of the spiritual relations of number and
figure." That the Church was not, as has been often charged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
responsible for this spiritualizing temper of the age is apparent to any
one familiar with the development of Greek philosophy and with
the history of the superstitions of the Roman Empire. Nevertheless,
it is also true that that temper has been increased in the past and
is fostered to-day by the undue emphasis which the Church has placed
upon the miraculous character of early Christianity.</p>

<p>3. We notice in the history of the thought of this period, both
in the Church and in the world at large, a disposition rather to
examine, criticise, and comment upon the work of others, than to do
investigating and thinking of one's own. That such a spirit should
be found in the Church is not to be wondered at, for the authority
of Christ and his apostles would seem to leave no room for originality
of thinking on religious subjects, and the sacred Scriptures
would give abundant scope for the exercise of the highest learning
and of intellectual penetration in interpreting. But the same tendency
is noticed outside of the Church, as the great schools of interpreters
of Aristotle and of Plato, and the large volumes of abstracts
and compilations from preceding writers, bear witness. But when
vast learning and ability are expended, rather on such labors than
on investigation into the secrets of Nature, science does not thrive.</p>

<p>4. And once again we observe the gradually increasing dogmatic
tendency of the Church, the claim to be the repository of all knowledge,
the stifling of thought, and of investigation into what might
lead men away from the truth and the "faith once delivered to the
saints."</p>

<p>It seemed best to give in detail these four evident reasons for
the barrenness of science during those centuries, because, as I said,
the same things to-day, though with decreasing force, interfere with
the progress of science and the extension of scientific method. I shall
refer to them again a little further on.</p>

<p>The great revival of four centuries ago in art, in learning, in
religion, reached also to science. At last the spell of ignorance, of
unreasoning prejudice, of offensive dogmatism, and of vague mysticism,
that had held the world for so long, was broken. The new
life of science was feeble at first, and remained long in its swaddling
clothes. It was about the middle of the sixteenth century that
Copernicus gave his great work to the world; then no great work
again for nearly one hundred years, when Kepler, Galileo, and
Stevinus arise. But the century has not been an idle one. Everywhere
men have been awakening to the new light, have begun to
think freely and fearlessly; are no longer deterred by the cry of
magic or the prohibition of church dignitaries from investigating
into Nature for themselves. And so, when in the seventeenth century
those mighty ones appeared, thoughtful people in great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
numbers were found to welcome the new truths; and at almost the same
time Descartes by his essay on Scientific Method, and Bacon by the
Novum Organum, were able to give an impetus to scientific investigation
such as the world had never felt before.</p>

<p>The history of the progress of science from that time to this
is too complex to receive any treatment in a paper of this character.
How it has been throughout a record of successive triumphs;
how gradually one department after another of Nature's workings
has been mastered and reduced to orderly system; how all systems
have been themselves reduced to one, harmonious and complete, in
the magnificent generalization of evolution; how all the time not
only has the sum of knowledge been steadily augmented, but the
power of acquiring knowledge marvelously enlarged&mdash;all of that
we know. That which has accomplished such results is science,
and the process employed has been scientific method. We are
in a position now to have a fairly intelligent idea of it. Look at
it and see.</p>

<p>"Scientific method" is not, of course, a technical expression, as
are induction, deduction, etc. Yet it means something very definite.
It is that method of dealing with phenomena which reason declares
and experience has shown to insure the greatest accuracy in results.
There are in the complete process four necessary steps: 1. Observation
of facts. 2. Comparison and classification, or generalization.
3. Deduction. 4. Verification.</p>

<p>We can see these steps alike in the simplest scientific attempt
of our remote ancestors, and in the work of a Newton or a
Darwin.</p>

<p>To use an illustration of the former suggested by the book of
Leviticus. In very early times it was noticed that animals that
had both the characteristics of being cloven-hoofed and of chewing
the cud were good for food. A new animal is discovered having
those characteristics. It is argued from the general principle laid
down that this new animal is good for food, and the matter is verified
by experiment. There are the four distinct steps: observation
of the facts, drawing a principle from the comparison of the facts,
deducing as to the particular case, verifying. The result is, of
course, not only a classifying of the particular case, but also the
extension of the principle. So with the generalization of the law
of gravitation. Numberless facts were observed with the greatest
care; from them the principle was generalized; from that again deductions
were made as to particular cases; and the results were verified.
But though the steps of the process are the same in both instances,
yet what a vast difference between them! Take the first
step, the observation of facts. All that the thought of the earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
age could do was to note a few striking resemblances and differences
among the animals that roamed the neighboring forests. What
could be done in the later age, ay, what the scientific temper of
the age demanded, was the most rigidly careful examination of multitudes
of facts; examination by a trained mind and with all the
improved appliances which science and art had given to the world,
and then submitted to the searching scrutiny of other trained minds,
with like appliances. Or take the last step, verification. In one
case it meant finding the effect upon the taste and upon the health.
In the other, what it meant may be judged from the account we have
of one of Newton's investigations. In applying his hypothesis of
gravitation (it was only a hypothesis then) to the motion of the
moon, there was a very slight divergence, about two feet a minute,
between the time of the revolution of the moon in its orbit, as he
calculated it and as he observed it. He was not satisfied until,
<i>eighteen years after</i>, on account of an improvement made in the
method of taking observations, he was able to obtain what he regarded
as a verification.</p>

<p>And so what we learn from the history of science is the gradual
<i>development</i> of scientific method. Scientific method in the work of
Hipparchus meant a very different thing from the scientific method
of the Chaldeans. Very different still is the scientific method of
studying the heavens to-day. So to an even greater degree is there
a difference between the scientific method of studying the earth to-day
and as our fathers studied it. It is not merely the multitude
of facts that we have learned, nor the marvelous instruments that
we have made to aid us in our observations; it is also, and by no
means least, this&mdash;that men all these centuries have been <i>learning</i>
to observe, to reason, and to verify.</p>

<p>We may say that science and scientific method have grown and
developed together: the development of one has invariably advanced
the development of the other, and, on the other hand, where one
has remained stationary, or has retrograded, so has the other.</p>

<p>History has enabled us to see this other fact also: that the conditions
which interfered with the growth of science in the past not
only interfere with it always, wherever they exist, but to very much
the same degree interfere with the free application of scientific method.
What those conditions were during one long period of history we
saw&mdash;a failure to realize its importance as compared with questions
of conduct; a tendency to comment rather than investigate; a tendency
to ascribe everything to spiritual agency rather than to natural
causes; and lastly, dogmatism. We very well know how, as
a matter of fact, those very conditions do interfere with the application
of scientific method to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>How far is scientific method applicable to the investigation of
the Bible? Is there any department of human knowledge to which
scientific method of investigation is not applicable? If scientific
method is what we defined it to be, that method of dealing with
phenomena which reason declares and experience has shown to insure
the greatest accuracy in results, then there is obviously no
department of knowledge to which that method is not applicable,
for it means simply the method which will bring us nearest to the
truth. When we are dealing with the highest spiritual verities we
use that method which will bring us nearest to the truth; we are
bound to use it in the interest of truth! That does not mean that
we are to look for material causes for spiritual phenomena; nor does
it mean that those things which in their nature appeal to the sensibilities,
or have to do with conduct, or require an exercise of faith,
must, in order for us to find out the truth, be removed from the domain
of sensibility, conduct, faith. That would be a most unscientific
method of investigation. The very first canon of scientific
method is that it be appropriate to the matter in hand. And so in
investigating the truths which are distinctly taught in the Bible&mdash;truths
which are of the nature of a revelation of God's will and
which are designed to reach and affect the whole nature of man&mdash;to
take no account of other faculties in a man besides his power of
apprehending intellectually, and of reasoning logically, would be
unscientific beyond hope of pardon.</p>

<p>But what I wish especially to consider is a different kind of investigation
of the Bible&mdash;one not concerned with the truths taught
in the Bible, but with the Bible itself, as a collection of writings that
has come down to us from the past. What is the nature of these
writings? Who are their authors? Are there any of them which
have more than one author? Are there any which are compilations
from several different sources? What is the age in which these
works were written or compiled? All of those, and similar questions,
are not only the appropriate but the necessary inquiries of a truth-loving
mind. They will continue to be asked until they are satisfactorily
answered. With reference to other writings, the persistence
of such inquiries will depend, except in cases of pure curiosity,
upon the importance of such writings to the world. On that principle
there will be no cessation of inquiries concerning the Bible until
they are, as I said, satisfactorily answered, for no other writings are
to be compared, in their importance to the world, with the writings
of the Bible. How can such answers be given? Where does competency
to give answer lie? Does it lie in the authority of the
Church? Not to lay any stress upon the fact, one way or the other,
that the Church, except in certain localities, has never declared on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
the canon of the Bible, much less on the questions proposed above,
there is no such authority residing in the Church, unless we grant
the claim sometimes made for her, to infallibility. With those making
such a claim we must, within the limits of this paper, decline to
argue.</p>

<p>But if not the Church, what other authority can give us the answers
we seek? The authority of primitive tradition, or of the
opinions of great commentators, or of the great mass of Christian
people of modern times? Authority which is so shadowy in other
things that might be mentioned would surely count for nothing in
a matter as grave as this. Or can particular expressions of the
Bible itself be taken to settle the matter once for all? But as to
most of those very questions the Bible itself is silent; and if it had
spoken, yet the question of competent authority would only be put
one step further back. Or, once again, can the answer come from
"the spirit which is in man," guided by God's Spirit? But in this,
as in the instance mentioned above, that which has been shown to
be incompetent in so many other things can not be called competent
in this.</p>

<p>There is, there can be, according to the requirement of our minds,
only one answer which will satisfy; it is that which is determined
by purely scientific method&mdash;that is to say, according to the nature
of the subject, that method of investigating literary works which
reason declares and experience has shown to insure the greatest accuracy
in results. That method is known by the name of the
"Higher Criticism."</p>

<p>What is the history of the higher criticism? One would imagine,
from the language often used by the opponents of its application
to the Bible, that it was an arbitrary method of criticism, invented
in these rationalizing times expressly for the purpose of doing
away with the divine character of the Bible. But higher criticism
has been in use in examining the classics and other (nonscriptural)
writings of former ages for fully two hundred years. The
first one to state its fundamental principles was Du Pin, in his New
History of Ecclesiastical Writers, published in 1694. In 1699
Bentley published his famous examination of the epistles of Phalaris,
according to the methods and principles of the higher criticism.
There is no better instance of scientific investigation as to authenticity.
These epistles had been commonly accepted by scholars as
the work of Phalaris, and accounted of great value. Bentley, by
his searching examination of them, proved them to be the forgery
of a sophist, so conclusively that no scholar worthy of the name
has ventured to question the result since. That, I say, was
in 1699.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>The first work in the way of higher criticism of the Bible,
Eichhorn's Introduction to the Old Testament, was not published till
nearly one hundred years later.</p>

<p>But that very modernness of the work brings it with some into
disfavor. "If that is the true way of investigating the biblical
writings," they say, "why are we so long in finding it out? Why
did not the fathers of the Church&mdash;mighty, indeed, as many of them
were, with keenness of insight into the Bible, with profound knowledge
of its characteristics, with substantially the same evidence before
them as we have now&mdash;why did not they give us the principles
of the higher criticism, if those principles are true?"</p>

<p>For the very same reason as science in general has not until
very lately begun to do its true work. How meager is all the scientific
work done in the ages of the past in comparison with that done
during the last three hundred years! Men were not up to it; they
were only learning the scientific method. So, the scientific method
of examining literature, men have not learned till within the past two
hundred years. Having all the facts before them which we have
now would avail nothing without the knowledge of <i>how</i> to observe,
to classify, to deduce, to verify, any more in the field of letters than
in the field of Nature; any more in the Bible than in other literary
works. Among the immense benefits which science has conferred
upon the world, surely this should not be accounted the least, that it
has taught us a method by which we may find out with ever-growing
certainty the truth concerning the Bible itself.</p>

<p>What, then, should be the attitude of lovers of truth toward the
higher criticism of the Bible? It can be only one&mdash;openness of
mind to the ready acceptance of its work. Not that all its present
results are to be accepted as final, for its work is still confessedly
incomplete. Moreover, we can not fail to see that all investigations
into the sacred Scriptures have not been prompted by a genuine
love of truth, nor carried on with that judicial mind that should
characterize every one working in the name of science. So that not
all that has been done in the name of the higher criticism has been
according to scientific method. Nevertheless, there are results
already obtained, bearing the stamp of truth&mdash;such as the composite
character of the Hexateuch; the double authorship of Isaiah; the post-exilic
date of many of the Psalms&mdash;results which to a scientific mind
have the practical certainty of a demonstration, but which the great
majority of Christian ministers, who are supposed to look at such
things intelligently, are not ready to accept.</p>

<p>Are not the ministry in general more zealous to do as St. Paul
says, "Hold fast that which is good," than either to do, as he also
says, "Prove all things," or to make sure that what they hold fast is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
the best? Well, undoubtedly that is the better way to do, if they are
to do only one&mdash;to "hold fast that which is good." And yet it
is a blessed thought that every brave, fearless effort which men make
toward finding out the truth, with every help that they can get
from reason and a knowledge of the past, is an effort after God.</p>

<p>The gold fields of the Klondike or Troandik district, as officially
designated, lie along or immediately about the waters, whether
direct or tributary, of the Klondike, an eastern affluent of the
Yukon, which discharges into the "father of northern waters"
at the site of Dawson. The Klondike itself, whose upper waters
are as yet only imperfectly known, seemingly carries but little
gold, the main quantity of the precious metal and that which has
made the region famous being contributed by one of its southern
arms, the Bonanza, and by a tributary of this, the Eldorado.
Hunker Creek, draining a mountainous district several miles
to the eastward of the Bonanza, and like it a southern affluent of
the Klondike, finds promise of a wealth but little if at all inferior
to that of the Bonanza. In a broader or more popular sense, the
Klondike region not only embraces the special district so designated
in the books of the Gold Commissioner, but also the entire tract
which heads up to the sources of the streams that have before been
mentioned, and thereby, with Quartz, Sulphur, and Dominion
Creeks as tributaries of Indian River, takes in the greater portion
of the Indian River mining district, and with Baker, Reindeer, and
other creeks on the west, the official districts indicated by these
names as well. With this limitation the region roughly defines an
area about forty miles square, whose northern boundary lies somewhat
to the north of the sixty-fourth parallel of latitude, and on
the west reaches to within about thirty-five miles of the international
boundary, the one hundred and forty-first meridian of west
longitude.</p>

<p>This area of approximately fifteen hundred square miles, which
but little exceeds that of Rhode Island or of the county of Cornwall
in England, may be broadly characterized as being gently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
mountainous, with elevations of five hundred to fifteen hundred feet, and
in the highest parts of about twenty-two hundred feet. Its lowest
depression is the valley of the Yukon, which, in itself occupying a
position about fourteen hundred feet above the sea, gives to these
points absolute elevations of three and nearly four thousand feet.
Dome Mountain, or, as it is frequently designated, simply "The
Dome," and less often "Solomon's Dome," "King Dome," and
"Mount Ophir," appears to be the culminating point of the entire
region; and its prominent position at the water parting of Bonanza,
Hunker, Sulphur, and Dominion Creeks makes it a noble figure in
the landscape, and the most interesting single feature to the prospector
and miner. No absolute determinations for altitude have
as yet been made for it, but when crossing the summit it seemed to
me that it could not be much under four thousand feet, and I believe
that Mr. Ogilvie gives to it about thirty-five hundred feet.
The landscape which this mountain dominates is surpassingly beautiful,
and I know of no finer view from similarly low mountains
than that which this one commands. The sharply incised wooded
valleys of the different streams that head up to it tear the mountain
into projecting buttresses, and in the ridge that leads off from
it southwestward contracts it to the extent of forming for half a
mile or more a narrow backbone or saddle. In this respect it reminded
me much of Mount Katahdin, in Maine. On a clear day
the distant main mass of the snow-capped Rocky Mountains is sharply
outlined against the northeastern sky, a most impressive setting
to the verdant slopes that trend off toward it, only to disappear
in the belt of plain that separates the two mountain systems. I
was unfortunate in not getting the full benefit of this view, as at
the time of my first crossing the atmosphere was very cloudy, and
on the second it was so surcharged with smoke from forest fires in
the valleys of Gold Bottom, Quartz, and Sulphur Creeks that hardly
more than the foreground was visible.</p>

<p>A succession of five or six knobs runs out from the ridge to
which reference has been made and which trends off in the direction
of the head waters of Eldorado, and these, together with the main
Dome, are sometimes spoken of as the "Seven Domes," but they
have no particular significance in the orographic detail and can not
even be said to be clearly defined to the eye. Dome Mountain is
held in a respect bordering almost on veneration by the Klondikers,
inasmuch as it is generally thought to be the mainspring of the gold
supply which is contained in the streams that fall off from it, and
this means nearly all the good and the promising streams of the
entire region. And, in truth, there is for the moment no way of
absolutely disposing of the miner's suppositions, nor can the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
circumstance that little or no gold has yet been found in place either on
or in the mountain be given much value in the discussion of the
probable origin of the gold, inasmuch as the same negative condition
confronts us in a study of the rocks of all other parts of the
same and adjoining regions. Assuming that alluvial gold is in the
main a derivative from reef gold, it is certainly strange that streams
flowing in well-nigh opposite directions, and yet rising within very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
short distances of one another, should be so largely charged with
gold, unless they have obtained it from a common source; nor can
the fact, as received and reported by most miners, but of the full
import of which I have not yet fully made up my mind, that the
different streams carry different classes of gold, be argued away as
having no significance in this connection. Claim holders profess
at most times to be able to distinguish between Eldorado gold and
that of Bonanza, between the gold of Bonanza and that of Hunker
or Dominion, and so on; and there is no question that marked differences
in color and in the contours of the coarse flakes and nuggets
do present themselves, and even in narrower limits than has here
been outlined. Thus, the gold from French Hill, abreast of Claim
17 on Eldorado, has a distinctiveness that is largely its own, and
hardly follows the gold of the rest of the Eldorado tract; and the
same is true of the gold of Skookum Hill in its relations to that of
Bonanza, and also of that of Victoria Gulch. Moreover, the recent
assays that have been made by the Bank of British North America
and the Canadian Bank of Commerce, in Dawson, of the gold of
the different creeks and gulches show plainly that marked differences
as to fineness are distinctive qualities&mdash;at least they appear
to be such at the present time. Thus, while Eldorado and
Bonanza gold generally assays but about $15.50 or $15.80 to the
ounce, Dominion gold shows as high as $17.80, and Hunker close
to $18.50; the gold of Bear Creek, a minor tributary of the Klondike,
is reported to actually give $19.20 to the ounce, falling only
behind the almost pure specimens that have been reported from
American Creek and Mynook, and to which a valuation of nearly
$20 has been given. If these assumed facts continue to be proved
true, then they must argue in favor of a distribution of gold from
largely localized spots or areas, a conclusion that is also pointed to
by a number of other circumstances. On the other hand, there are
some facts which point in quite the opposite direction, and some of
these will be referred to later on.</p>

<p>None of the mountains of the region even approximates the snow
line, which would here probably occupy a position not much below
six thousand feet, and on the northern face perhaps even rise to
seven thousand feet. Not a vestige of snow was seen by me when
crossing the Dome, not even in the most sheltered hollows, a condition
that at first strikes one as strange, considering that in so many
parts of our own mountains of equal or less elevation snow may be
found lingering through a long period of the summer months. But
here the greatly protracted hours of summer daylight and heat, together
with the correspondingly diminished period of night, when
a regelation might take place or melting at least could be arrested,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
have a marked influence in dissipating the winter's snows and ice
when these are not particularly heavy. I did not find the August
heat quite so intense on the mountain tops as I had been led to
suppose that it would be, but there was quite enough of it to satisfy
an ample vegetation and to make heavy garments in walking more
than a luxury. Unfortunately, my thermometer was away from
me at this time, and as sensation in this dry northern climate is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
difficult to gauge by the standard of the mercurial index, I shall
not hazard a guess as to the actual reading.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Vale of Eldorado.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Taking the mountains in their entirety, it is difficult from single
points of view to determine for them any definite relation. There
are so many valleys in close proximity to one another, some very
ancient and others relatively modern, and with trends so opposed in
all directions, that in the absence of a dominant ridge or mass this
relation becomes very confused; and I was not in a position, with
the limited time at my command and the deficiency of rock outcrops,
to positively define any main line or axis of uplifts. Yet I
suspect that there is one such, with a generally east and west bearing,
whose trend might correspond with that of the ridge already
referred to, which, with a southwesterly deflection, unites Dome
Mountain with the mass that separates the upper Eldorado from
Chief Gulch. What strikes one as particularly interesting in the
conformation of some of these mountains when seen from an elevation
is their hummocky appearance. This is particularly noticeable
in the mountains which close in the Eldorado and Bonanza Valleys.
With considerable actual elevations, they convey the impression
of being merely swells or undulations of an open surface, very
much like magnified morainic knolls in a glaciated country. This
depressed type of mountain structure, with the evidence of its expanded
valleys and gently flowing contours, carries with it the proof
of long-continued degradation, and of a history whose pages read
far back into geological chronology.</p>

<p>With the evidences of antiquity before us, there are yet indications,
amounting, it seems to me, almost to proof, that many of
the more pronounced features of the region date their origin from
only a comparatively recent period. Such is the case with a number
of valleys that are tributary to the main ones, and even the
latter appear to have been modified by late stream displacements.
Taking the Eldorado or Bonanza, with their open U-shaped troughs
and in most parts gently sloping banks, as types of the older valleys,
it is surprising to note how many of their tributaries have the deeply
incised and narrow contours; and I am led almost to conclude that
some of these are really of very late construction. The stream displacements,
which, by reason of the indices they give to the finding
of new placers, are now beginning to be so attentively studied by
the miner and prospector, are emphatic in their testimony in this
direction.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> One has but to note the triangular area that is included<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
between French Gulch (tributary to Eldorado abreast of Claims 17
and 18) and Adams Creek (tributary to Bonanza at Claim 6 below
Discovery) to be convinced of the actuality of recent transformations.
Most of the miners regard the high-level gravels of this
tract&mdash;of French Hill, Gold Hill (opposite to Grand Forks Village),
Skookum Hill, and Adams Hill&mdash;so rich in gold as to make the
claims fairly the rivals of the creek claims, as representing the ancient
high-level flow of the Eldorado and Bonanza, but I am convinced
that this is not the case (although it is certain that both
streams mentioned did at one time flow at as high, and even considerably
higher, levels). The materials that so largely distinguish
these bench or hillside gravels (placers) are in greater part rounded
bowlders or cobbles of white quartz, with a marked deficiency of
the fragmented schists and slates which make pay dirt and bed rock
in the course of the streams below.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Grand Forks Village.&mdash;Valley of the Bonanza.</span></span>
</div>

<p><i>Per contra</i>, the creek claims of Eldorado and Bonanza contain,
as a rule, only an insignificant quantity of the rounded quartz bowlders,
while almost everywhere where excavations have been made
the body and substance of the output are the flattened and discoid
parts of the mother-rock of most of the region&mdash;quartzitic, micaceous,
hornblendic, and chloritic schists, and with them a less quantity
of gneissic and dioritic rock. The high quartz-capped knob to
which reference has already been made as marking the water parting
of French, Nine Mile, and Adams Creeks, has large quartz
masses entering into its composition, whether as bosses, dikes, or
veins, and to them, or rather their wasted parts, must we look for
the source which has so generously supplied the materials of the
French-Adams Hills benches. There has been a bad break-up in
this quarter, and the materials resulting from it have been swept
into the confluence (delta) of the two streams which define the main
valleys. Furthermore, the descending arcuate contour lines which
are so well marked by terrace slopes on that face of French Hill
which is turned to the corner of Eldorado and French Gulch, show
plainly the receding course, in the direction of south, of French
Creek (Gulch). On the hill slopes south of the position which it
now occupies there is none of that deposit which lies to the north
of it; the riches of French Hill are delimited by French Gulch,
and even in the gulch itself there is nothing that can be compared
with what is found on the heights. Again, on the side of Eldorado
opposite to French and Gold Hills there is the same deficiency as
regards the characteristic bench deposits, and this also holds true
with the Bonanza opposite Skookum and Adams Hills. If these
high-level deposits were in fact the ancient waste of the Eldorado
and Bonanza, we should naturally expect to find at least "outliers"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
on the less favored bank of the streams, and surely in the case of the
Eldorado former evidence of this deposition ought to be had on the
hillsides, similarly contoured to those of the north, which lie south
of and immediately adjoining French Gulch.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Sluicing on the Bonanza.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Through virtually the entire Klondike tract and far beyond it
on all sides there are evidences of high water flows. No more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
perfect presentation of high-level terraces can be had than that which
defines the first line of heights, of perhaps one hundred and fifty
to two hundred feet, which so beautifully impress the landscape of
the Yukon about Dawson. The observer, from a still loftier elevation,
notes these flat-topped banks, having the regularity of railroad
constructions, following the course of the river as far as the
eye can reach, here perhaps interrupted by a too steeply washed
buttress, elsewhere washed to low level by some stream which has
taken a transverse direction. A somewhat higher line of benches
curves around the still higher points of eminence, and defines the
course of water across country&mdash;such, at least, it is to-day. And all
the way to the top, scattered evidences of the recent presence of
water can still be found. I met with rolled or water-worn pebbles
so near to the top (the actual summit and not the position of the
signal flag) of the high peak overlooking Dawson that it may safely
be assumed that they also occur on the very apex (about eleven hundred
feet above the present level of the Yukon), a conclusion which
is more than strengthened by the finding of pebbles at even a greater
elevation on the French-Adams Creek knob. While thus presenting
the evidence of high water levels, I am far from convinced that
this evidence points exclusively to river flows. Much more does it
appear that, in one part of its history at least, we are dealing with
the evidences of the past existence of large lakelike bodies of water,
perhaps even of a vast inland sea. The contours of the country in
a sort of ill-defined way suggest this interpretation&mdash;an interpretation
that is not, however, without evidence to support it, and which
seems also to have been entertained before me by McConnell and
by Israel Russell. The latter investigator has, indeed, given the
name of Lake Yukon to a former extensive body of water, of which
the existing Lakes Lebarge, Marsh, Tagish, and Bennett, with the
connecting Yukon, are only dissociated parts. This lake is assumed
to have been about one hundred and fifty miles in length, with a
surface elevated between twenty-five hundred and twenty-seven
hundred feet above the sea.</p>

<p>First in the line of evidence may perhaps be taken the universality
of wash gravel and of terrace <i>d&eacute;bris</i> and the great heights
which they occupy. While I have not myself observed such evidences
of water action on the very summit of the Dome, there is reason
to believe that they do or at least did exist. Most of this summit,
in its narrowed form and rapidly descending slopes, has been,
if one may use the expression, more than washed off, and could
hardly be expected to retain for any great length of time accumulations
of loose fragmental material. But at least its far-off continuation
near the source (right fork) of Eldorado Creek bears some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
of it on its shoulder, and I have also seen it in an excavation on the
loftily located Claim 71 of that stream. Nearly abreast of the international
boundary, the one hundred and forty-first meridian of
west longitude (Greenwich), McConnell and Russell noted the terrace
line of the Yukon River as high up as seven hundred and thirty
feet, which is still about four hundred feet below the point where
I obtained wash gravel on the peak back of Dawson; but Dr. George
Dawson found the terraces on Dease Lake to rise to thirty-six hundred
and sixty feet, and elsewhere he calls attention to having come
across water-rolled gravel at an elevation of forty-three hundred
feet, which would probably exceed by about six hundred feet the
culminating point of Dome Mountain. Such high water could, with
the existing configuration of the land surface, hardly define any
other feature than that of a large interior sea or of a series of lake
basins; and while it may be argued that there has been sufficient
degradation of the land surface since the period of the height of
water to permit us to reconstruct a contour that would be in harmony
with altered and reduced river courses, and relieve us from
the necessity of invoking the assistance of lacustrine bodies in a
solution of the problem, it does not seem to me likely that this has
been the case. The physiognomy of the upper Yukon Valley supports
this contention, and even to-day the river has not yet fully
escaped from a lacustrine condition which is merely fragmental of a
previous state.</p>

<p>On one point bearing upon the succession of events in the upper
Yukon Valley, and which has its connection with the history of the
Klondike region, my conclusions differ somewhat from those that
have been expressed by Dawson. This pertains to the deposit of
volcanic ash which is so marked a feature of the accumulations of
the river's banks. For nearly three hundred miles by the course of
the river a stratum of pumiceous ash, ordinarily not more than
four or six inches in thickness, constitutes almost without break
the top layer but one of the banks on either side, and that which is
above it is generally only the insignificant soil or subsoil which immediately
supports the vegetation. So persistent is this ash layer,
and so uniformly does it hold to an even thickness and to its exact
position beneath the surface, that without further examination one
would be tempted to believe from a little distance that it was merely
the ordinary subsoil layer from which the color had been leached
out by vegetable growths. Here and there, where there have been
local disturbances or water washings have produced concentration,
it may have acquired a development of a few feet, and occasionally
it has accommodated itself to flexures or saggings of the deposits
which it normally caps as a horizontal zone. Dr. Dawson, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
commenting upon its occurrence, correctly assumes that it represents
one continuous volcanic eruption, the date of which might fall well
within a period of a few hundred years, and he speculates as to its
being possibly associated with an outbreak from Mount Wrangel
or some active cone which is represented by the Indians to exist in
the region of the upper White River. Beyond this, from the normality
of its position, and the assumed fact that no fluviatile or
aqueous deposits have been found overlying it, the same observer
argues that the outbreak must have taken place subsequent to the
formation of the present river courses and their valleys, a conclusion
in which I do not see my way to concur. The only satisfactory
interpretation of this vast uniformly placed and uniformly layered
deposit of ash is to me that which assumes a deposition in a widely
extended lake basin, or in shallow lagoon waters which already in
part occupied the present valley surfaces. In such waters precipitation
from long-continued suspension would proceed gradually and
evenly, to the end of shaping a deposit of nearly uniform development
and of vast extent. Such depositions we find in the valleys
lying north of the City of Mexico (Zumpango, Tequixquiac) and
in the lacustrine area of Anahuac, also in the famous fossiliferous
basin of Florissant, in Colorado. With the subsequent formation
or reformation of the river's course we should have this deposit cut
through, with the result of presenting the even layer which is so
persistent in its following. This method would also account for
the anomalous position in which we find the ash deposits; while still
holding the same relation to the top surface, it occasionally rises far
above what might be assumed to be its normal height or level above
the water's surface&mdash;from four to ten feet&mdash;a condition that would
hardly be in consonance with the assumption that the ash was deposited
after the actual river channels had been cut. But other
and more direct proof of aqueous occupation after the laying of the
ash is had in the fact that in one place at least, and doubtless many
more such will be found on closer investigation, lacustrine or fluviatile
shells (subfossils) occur in the layer overlying the ash. A
locality of this kind is found on the right bank not many miles above
the Five Finger Rapids. Here, at a height of not more than four
feet above the river, I had the pleasure of determining species of
<i>Limnea</i> and <i>Physa</i>, associated singularly enough with <i>Helix</i>, in
the layers immediately above and below the ash bed, and in both
horizons the species were identical. This isolated fact speaks volumes
for itself. Had this been the region of Helena, Ark., I should
have been prompted to class the bed with a portion of the Mississippi
loess. What interested me further in this connection was the
fact that up to this time I had failed to bring to light one solitary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
mollusk from the upper Yukon, and to all inquiries regarding the
existence of shellfish in this northern water invariably a negative
reply was received. Only on that day did I again obtain success
in my malacological effort, the almost icy waters rewarding my
search with a single specimen&mdash;unfortunately subsequently lost&mdash;of
a <i>Bythinella</i>, or some closely related type, so that even to-day my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
knowledge does not permit me to state if the subfossil species of
the banks have their living representatives, either specific or generic,
in the almost wholly noncalcareous waters of the existing river.
The question from more points than one is interesting, and deserves
more than passing attention. It may be remarked in this place
that the only other fluviatile invertebrate which I found in these
waters was a white siliceous coating sponge, whose statoblasts were
well visible to the naked eye. Unfortunately, the loss of my specimens
has prevented determination, a circumstance the more to be
deplored as these fresh-water sponges are the most northern in habit
known to the zo&ouml;logist.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>There is evidence of another kind pointing to a comparative
newness of much of the present course of the Yukon. The feature
has been noticed alike by nongeographers and geographers, and by
geologists as well, that the arm which carries the greatest volume
of water does not everywhere occupy the main orographic valley.
Thus, as Dawson has well pointed out, in coming up the stream the
valley of the Big Salmon appears to be more nearly the continuation
of the main valley below than that which still (and properly) continues
to be designated the Lewes (Yukon) above; and this is still
more markedly the case with the Hootalinqua (Teslin-too or Newberry
River) at the confluence with the Thirty Mile. Even the
valley of the Pelly at its junction with the Yukon, near Fort Selkirk,
would perhaps to most persons suggest itself as the main channel
of erosion. There is no hardship to geological facts in invoking
the aid of great displacements to account for a condition which to
my mind is well impressed upon the landscape; for, even without
the proper or fully satisfactory evidence in hand to support the
view, I fully believe that the greater part of the upper Yukon tract
only recently emerged from a lacustrine condition. Nor is it to
me by any means certain that this emergence or final reconstruction
of the land surface into valley tracts need be more than a few hundred
years old, or necessarily older than the deposition of the volcanic
ash, which is hypothetically carried back to Dawson to a possible
five hundred years or so. If it should be objected that we
know of no such rapid change in the configuration of a land surface
brought about by aqueous agencies, it might be answered that the
mechanics of erosion in a pre-eminently drift-covered region, under
subarctic conditions and with the influence of a most powerful
and energetic stream near by, have neither been studied nor
observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
Let us examine the possibilities of the case. As an initiatory
premise it might be assumed, without much chance of either affirmation
or denial, that the degradation of the land surface in the immediate
valleys of the main streams is or has been in the past taking
place at the rate of half a line per day; so far as the eye and ordinary
instruments of measurement are concerned this is a quite inappreciable
amount, and I see no reason why it may not be assumed
as the working power of the Yukon. With this rate of erosion a
valley trough or contour of about a foot and a third might be
formed in the period of a single year, or of nearly seven hundred
feet in five hundred years; and if we lessen the daily erosion
to one quarter of the amount stated&mdash;i. e., to an eighth of
a line&mdash;we should still have in this same period of five hundred
years, speaking broadly, a trough of about one hundred and seventy-five
feet depth, quite sufficient to have brought about most marked
changes in the aspect of a drift-covered lagoon region, and perhaps
ample to account for those physiognomic peculiarities which have
been discovered. I am fully impressed with the magnitude of the
distance which separates the amount of erosion which I have assumed&mdash;an
eighth of a line daily&mdash;from the "one foot in six thousand
years," which has been preached categorically from lecturn
and text-book for the better part of a quarter of a century and
threatens to make dogma for still another period of equal length;
but the conditions here are entirely different from those of average
continental denudation&mdash;in fact, have as nearly nothing in common
as they can have. My observations in the tropics and subtropics
have most impressively taught me the lesson of rapid changes, and
with the conditions that are and have been associated with the
Yukon, I am prepared for the lesson of equal change in the north.
But, as a matter of fact, are we not taught of a removal in the west
central United States of some twelve thousand feet of rock strata
in a period not impossibly considerably less than two hundred thousand
years? The one foot in sixteen years has here likewise nothing
in common with the "prevailing" rate of continental destruction.</p>

<p>While stalled on a bar on the Yukon River, about two miles
above Fort Selkirk, I was much impressed with the mechanical work
of the stream. The gravel and pebbles were being hurried along rapidly
under the lash of a five to six mile current, and their groans were
audible frequently when they themselves were invisible. Every
few minutes our steamer would swerve from her seemingly fixed position
by the undercutting of the bar, and perhaps it would be not
far from the truth in saying that we should be to-day in very nearly
the same position that we were in then had it not been for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
undermining action of the stream. Let it be remembered that the
Yukon has a current ranging up to seven miles, or to eight, as some
of the navigators say, and that in certain months it is swiftly ice-bound
both on top and at the bottom, and heavily charged with
bowlders, and one may well realize the work of which it is capable.
That with which I have debited it is purely hypothetical or conjectural,
but it may serve a purpose in the elucidation of the main
problem.</p>

<p>In its more distinctively geological relations the Klondike region
may be broadly defined as one composed in the main of schists
and schistose rocks, defining an area of considerable disturbance.
Owing to the limited number of outcrops, by far the greater part
of the surface being still buried beneath vegetation of one kind or
another, the variety of rocks included within the region can best be
told from an examination of creek bowlders or the different dumps
that mark hundreds of diggings and prospect holes along the various
valleys and gulches. Some of this output, in which may be found
fragments of quartz and quartzitic schist, of mica, hornblende, and
chloritic schists and slates, of granitic gneiss and gneissose granite,
porphyry, diabase, diorite, and quartz (quartzite), is probably extra-territorial,
having been washed in at a time when a more extensive
foreign water had access to the region; but there is enough of outcrop
to show that most, and perhaps all, of the types here indicated
are really a part of the tract. The schists and schistose rocks, whose
age from direct evidence in the field I was unable to determine, but
which are almost certainly the equivalents in greater part of the
Birch Creek series, as described by Spurr from the American side
(Birch Creek and Forty Mile districts), constitute the kernel of the
region. Observation is as yet too limited to permit of a positive
classification of these schists according to their natural relations,
and the reasons that have prompted some to consider them as being
in part of pre-Paleozoic age are not quite clear to me, although they
may easily be such. Of granite and true gneiss in position I saw
practically nothing, and the limestones and marble were not sufficient
in quantity to permit me to identify the heavy beds which are
considered to be the distinguishing element of the Forty Mile series.
The beds where exposed show in most parts steep dips&mdash;in places
standing almost vertically&mdash;but in how far these dips are uniform
or the reverse, or in any way define a line of strike with anticlinals
and synclinals, must be left for future close examination to
ascertain.</p>

<p>Great lumps of white or pinkish quartz, some of them <i>in situ</i>,
others washed or rolled down the open slopes, occur at many points
of some of the mountain elevations, indicating the presence of dikes
and gash veins, and in part of interstratified beds containing this
material. I found much of it at several "horizons" of the slope
back of French Hill, and also as a cap overlying the badly cleaved
and fragmented schists of the summit (three thousand feet?) of the
prominent knob which dominates this region. The same type of
"kidney" quartz appears at repeated intervals on the slope leading
up to the Dome, almost immediately after leaving the junction of
Carmack's Fork with the Bonanza, and also on the saddle ridge
which might properly be considered to be a part of the summit of
Dome Mountain. Prospectors have in nearly all cases staked these
assumed outcrops of quartz, recognizing them as ledges, and in a
number of them have claimed the discovery of the "mother lode."
So far as visible gold is concerned, I have in nearly all cases found
them to be absolutely barren, and I do not think at this time that
there is much chance of finding anything materially valuable in
them, although events might prove the reverse. Most of the quartz
that has so far been discovered in direct association with the gold&mdash;that
is to say, wrapped up with or within itself, as in the case of
the quartz-gold nuggets of French Hill&mdash;is of a gray-blue or pinkish
tint and of a granular and nonspathic type, therefore differing materially
in aspect and structure from the quartz of the hillsides and
from the greater number of the quartz bowlders that are contained
in the dumps or have been removed from bed rock. Some of the
bowlders or rolled pebbles containing coarse gold are of the same
character of quartz as the quartz of the hillsides. Notably one
such was shown to me as coming from a high-bench claim (Millett's)
on Adams Hill (left "limit" [bank] of Bonanza, between Little
Skookum and Adams Creek), and other similar fragments taken
from the rock <i>in situ</i> were observed on Gay Gulch and the ridge
which separates the head waters of this stream from those of Eldorado.
In a dump at the mouth of Gay Gulch (a right-hand tributary
of Eldorado abreast of Claim 37) I found fragments of rotted
quartz which were well sprinkled with fine gold.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a href="images/illo_031-maplarge.jpg"><img src="images/illo_031-map.jpg" width="600" height="575" alt="APPROXIMATE MAP OF THE KLONDIKE REGION" /></a>
<span class="caption">APPROXIMATE MAP OF THE KLONDIKE REGION</span>
</div>

<p>It does not by any means appear so conclusive to me as seemingly
it does to Professor Spurr that because in some gulches the gold
heads up in increasing quantities the nearer we approach the beginnings
(heads) of these gulches, and that with this approach the
coarseness of the grains and nuggets likewise increases, we are necessarily
forced to assume that the travel of the gold at large has been
confined within the boundaries of the gulches in which it is at present
contained, or that its source is to be sought near by. A number
of the most "solid" streams of the Klondike region, such as the
Bonanza and Eldorado, if we are permitted to judge from the evidence
of outputs and of prospects up to the present time, hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a><br /><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
sustain the conditions of the American creeks. The richest claims
on the Eldorado are, starting from its mouth&mdash;the junction of the
Bonanza&mdash;4, 5, 12, 13, 29, 30, 31, 36, with other claims abundantly
rich between these. Number 30 is, I believe, generally considered
to be the banner claim, and it is situated about three miles up&mdash;far
enough, perhaps, to sustain in a superficial way Professor Spurr's
generalization as to location&mdash;and above it 36 is not unlikely to show
up as well as any of the other creek claims below. But the valley
of Eldorado, whether constricted or open, continues for miles beyond
either of its two head forks&mdash;that which is known as Eldorado
proper, and the one, Chief, or Chief Isaac Gulch, which is geographically
the continuation. So little has been found above 36 or 37
that the stream in that part is ordinarily spoken of as being barren.
Again, so far as the tributaries on either side of Eldorado are concerned,
and the possibility that they are responsible for the gold
that is contained in the main stream between 37 and 1 rather than
the Eldorado itself&mdash;a condition in no way impossible or improbable&mdash;it
can only be said for them that up to this time they have, with
the possible exception of Oro Grande (tributary to Eldorado abreast
of Claim 31), yielded very little gold themselves, and have hardly
given indication of containing much of a supply. I have used the
words "up to this time" advisedly, because I am aware upon how
little the evil reputation of a gulch rests, and how prospectors deceive
themselves by the character of their defective prospect holes.
Hence, while my argument is drawn from existing evidence, it can
not be assumed that this evidence is by any means sufficient to warrant
a conclusion. It is by no means unlikely that some of the lateral
gulches will really be found to be largely gold-bearing, and of
such Gay Gulch and the left-fork ascending of Eldorado (Eldorado
proper above 47) appear to me the most promising.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The condition of the Bonanza is very similar to that of the Eldorado.
Its greatest wealth, as so far determined, is concentrated in
its middle course, beginning about five miles above its mouth and
terminating some six miles below its source. But very little gold,
if the information given to me is correct, has been taken out from
or determined to exist in the tract lying above Claim 42 above Discovery,
or the mouth of Victoria Gulch (left-hand tributary, whose
source is found on a ridge from the opposite side of which Gay
Gulch descends to the Eldorado), and yet the valley continues open
and without material change for at least two miles, and with a certain
contraction for four miles more. Barring the Eldorado and
the streams coming in from the same side nearest to it&mdash;Big Skookum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
Little Skookum, and Adams&mdash;few if any of the side gulches
of the Bonanza are known to be really rich in gold, and for the moment,
at least, they can hardly be looked upon as having furnished
the main supply to the main stream.</p>

<h2>THE RACE PROBLEM IN THE UNITED STATES.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By BOOKER T. WASHINGTON</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">PRINCIPAL OF THE TUSKEGEE NORMAL INSTITUTE.</span></p>


<p>I have been asked a number of times during the last few months
the cause of and the cure for the riots that have taken place recently
in North Carolina and South Carolina. I am not at all sure
that what I shall say will answer these questions in a satisfactory
way, nor shall I attempt to narrow my expressions to a mere recital
of what has taken place in these two States. I prefer to discuss the
problem in a broader manner.</p>

<p>In the first place, in politics I am a Republican, but have always
refrained from activity in party measures, and expect to pursue this
policy in the future; so in this article I shall refrain, as I always have
done, from entering upon any discussion of mere party politics, in
the narrow and usual sense. What I shall say of politics will bear
upon the race problem and the civilization of the South in the larger
sense. In no case would I permit my political relations to stand in
the way of my speaking and acting in the manner that I believe is
going to be for the permanent interest of my race and the whole
South, regardless of mere party name and organization.</p>

<p>In 1873 the negro in the South had reached the point of greatest
activity and influence in public life, so far as the mere holding
of elective office was concerned. From this date those who have
kept up with the history of the South have noticed that the negro has
steadily lost in the number of elective offices held. In saying this
I do not mean that the negro has gone backward in the real and more
fundamental things of life. On the contrary, he has gone forward
faster than has been true of any other race in history, under anything
like similar circumstances.</p>

<p>If we can answer the question as to why the negro has lost
ground in the matter of holding elective office in the South, perhaps
we shall find that our reply will prove to be our answer also as
to the cause of the recent riots in North Carolina and South Carolina.
Before beginning a discussion of the question I have asked, I
wish to say that this change in the political influence of the negro
has continued from year to year, notwithstanding the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
for a long time he was protected politically, by force of Federal
arms and the most rigid Federal laws, and still more effectively,
perhaps, by the voice and influence in the halls of legislation of
such advocates of the rights of the negro race as Charles Sumner,
Benjamin F. Butler, James A. Garfield, Oliver P. Morton, Carl
Schurz, and Roscoe Conkling; and on the stump and through the
public press by those great and powerful negroes, Frederick Douglass,
John M. Langston, Blanche K. Bruce, John R. Lynch, P. B. S.
Pinchback, Robert Browne Elliot, and many others; but the negro
has continued for twenty years to have fewer representatives in
the State and national legislatures. The reduction has continued
until now it is to the point where, with few exceptions, he is without
representatives in the lawmaking bodies of the State and of the
nation.</p>

<p>Now, let us find, if we can, a cause for this. The negro is fond
of saying that his present condition is due to the fact that the State
and Federal courts have not sustained the laws passed for the protection
of the rights of his people, but I think we shall have to go
deeper than this, because I believe that all agree that court decisions,
as a rule, represent the public opinion of the community or nation
creating and sustaining the court.</p>

<p>At the beginning of his freedom, it was unfortunate that those
of the white race who won the political confidence of the negro were
not, with few exceptions, men of such high character as would lead
them to assist him in laying a firm foundation for his development.
Their main purpose appears to have been, for selfish ends in too
many instances, merely to control his vote. The history of the
reconstruction era will show that this was unfortunate for all the
parties in interest.</p>

<p>It would have been better, from any point of view, if the native
Southern white man had taken the negro, at the beginning of his
freedom, into his political confidence, and exercised an influence
and control over him before his political affections were alienated.
In the light of present experience, I think all will now agree
that the ballot would have meant more to the negro and would
have been more lasting in its results, would have caused less opposition,
if it had been given to him gradually, as he came into possession
of education.</p>

<p>The average Southern white man has the idea to-day that if
the negro were permitted to get any political power all the mistakes
of the reconstruction period would be repeated. He forgets or
ignores the fact that thirty years of acquiring education and property
and character have produced a higher type of black man than
existed thirty years ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>But to be more specific for all practical purposes, there are two
political parties in the South&mdash;a black man's party and a white man's
party. In saying this, I do not mean that all white men are Democrats,
for there are some white men in the South of the highest character
who are Republicans, and there are a few negroes in the South
of the highest character who are Democrats. It is the general understanding
that all white men are Democrats, or the equivalent,
and that all black men are Republicans. So long as the color line
is the dividing line in politics, so long will there be trouble.</p>

<p>The white man feels that he owns most of the property, furnishes
the negro most of his employment, that he pays most of the taxes,
and, besides, has had years of experience in government. There is
no mistaking the fact that the feeling which, in some way, has
heretofore taken possession of the negro&mdash;that to be manly and
stand by his race he must oppose the Southern white man with his
vote&mdash;has had much to do with intensifying the opposition to him.</p>

<p>The Southern white man says that it is unreasonable for the
negro to come to him, in a large measure, for his clothes, board,
shelter, and education, and for his politics to go to men a thousand
miles away. The Southern white man argues that when the negro
votes he should in a larger measure try to consult the interests
of his employer, just as the Pennsylvania employee tries to vote for
the interests of his employer.</p>

<p>The Southern white man argues, further, that much of the
education which has been given the negro has been defective in
not preparing him to love labor and to earn his living at some special
industry, and has, in too many cases, resulted in tempting him to
live by his wits as a political creature, or by trusting to his "influence"
as a political timeserver.</p>

<p>Then there is no mistaking the fact that much opposition to the
negro in politics is due to the circumstance that the Southern white
man has not got accustomed to seeing the negro exercise political
power, either as a voter or as an officeholder. Again, we want
to bear it in mind that the South has not yet reached the point
where there is that strict regard for the enforcement of the law
against either black or white men that there is in many of our
Northern and Western States. This laxity in the enforcement of
the laws in general, and especially of criminal laws, makes such
outbreaks as those in North Carolina and South Carolina of easy
occurrence.</p>

<p>Then there is one other consideration which must not be overlooked:
it is the common opinion of almost every black man and
almost every white man that nearly everybody who has had anything
to do with the making of laws bearing upon the protection of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
negro's vote has proceeded on the theory that all the black men for
all time are going to vote the Republican ticket, and that all the
white men in the South are going to vote the Democratic ticket;
in a word, all seemed to have taken it for granted that the two
races are always going to oppose each other in their voting.</p>

<p>In all the foregoing statements I have not attempted to define
my own views or position, but simply to describe conditions as I have
observed them, that might throw light upon the cause of our political
troubles.</p>

<p>As to my own position in all these matters I do not favor the
negro's giving up anything which is fundamental and which has
been guaranteed to him by the Constitution of the United States. It
is not best for him to relinquish any of his rights; nor would his
doing so be best for the Southern white man. Every law placed in
the Constitution of the United States was placed there to encourage
and stimulate the highest citizenship. If the negro is not stimulated
and encouraged by just State and national laws to become the
highest type of citizen, the result will be worse for the Southern
white man than for the negro. Take the State of South Carolina,
for example, where nearly two thirds of the population are negroes.
Unless these negroes are encouraged by just election laws to become
taxpayers and intelligent producers, the white people of South
Carolina will have an eternal millstone about their necks.</p>

<p>In addressing the Southern white people at the opening of the
Atlanta Exposition, in 1895, I said:</p>

<p>"There is no escape through law of man or God from the inevitable:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'The laws of changeless justice bind<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oppressor with oppressed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And close as sin and suffering joined<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We march to fate abreast.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Nearly sixteen millions of hands will aid you in pulling the load
upward, or they will pull against you the load downward. We
shall constitute one third and more of the ignorance and crime of the
South, or one third of its intelligence and progress; we shall contribute
one third to the business and industrial property of the South,
or we shall prove a veritable body of death, stagnating, depressing,
retarding every effort to advance the body politic."</p>

<p>Subsequently, in an open letter to the State Constitutional Convention
of Louisiana, I wrote:</p>

<p>"I am no politician; on the other hand, I have always advised
my race to give attention to acquiring property, intelligence, and
character, as the necessary basis of good citizenship, rather than
to mere political agitation. But the question upon which I write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
is out of the region of ordinary politics: it affects the civilization of
two races, not for to-day alone, but for a very long time to come;
it is up in the region of duty of man to man, of Christian to
Christian.</p>

<p>"Since the war no State has had such an opportunity to settle
for all time the race question, so far as it concerns politics, as is now
given to Louisiana. Will your convention set an example to the
world in this respect? Will Louisiana take such high and just
grounds in respect to the negro that no one can doubt that the
South is as good a friend to the negro as he possesses elsewhere? In
all this, gentlemen of the convention, I am not pleading for the
negro alone, but for the morals, the higher life of the white man
as well; for the more I study this question, the more I am convinced
that it is not so much a question as to what the white man
will do with the negro as to what the negro will do with the white
man's civilization.</p>

<p>"The negro agrees with you that it is necessary to the salvation
of the South that restriction be put upon the ballot. I know that
you have two serious problems before you: ignorant and corrupt
government on the one hand, and on the other a way to restrict the
ballot, so that control will be in the hands of the intelligent, without
regard to race. With the sincerest sympathy with you in your
efforts to find a good way out of the difficulty, I want to suggest
that no State in the South can make a law that will provide an opportunity
or temptation for an ignorant white man to vote and withhold
the opportunity or temptation for an ignorant colored man
without injuring both men. No State can make a law that can
thus be executed without dwarfing for all time the morals of the
white man in the South. Any law controlling the ballot that is
not absolutely just and fair to both races will work more permanent
injury to the whites than to the blacks.</p>

<p>"The negro does not object to an educational and property test,
but let the law be so clear that no one clothed with State authority
will be tempted to perjure and degrade himself by putting one interpretation
upon it for the white man and another for the black man.
Study the history of the South, and you will find that where there
has been the most dishonesty in the matter of voting, there you will
find to-day the lowest moral condition of both races. First, there
was the temptation to act wrongly with the negro's ballot. From
this it was an easy step to act dishonestly with the white man's ballot,
to the carrying of concealed weapons, to the murder of a negro, and
then to the murder of a white man, and then to lynching. I entreat
you not to pass a law that will prove an eternal millstone about
the necks of your children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>"No man can have respect for the Government and officers of
the law when he knows, deep down in his heart, that the exercise of
the franchise is tainted with fraud.</p>

<p>"The road that the South has been compelled to travel during
the last thirty years has been strewn with thorns and thistles. It
has been as one groping through the long darkness into the light.
The time is not far distant when the world will begin to appreciate
the real character of the burden that was imposed upon the South
when four million ex-slaves, ignorant and impoverished, were given
the franchise. No people has ever been given such a problem to
solve. History has blazed no path through the wilderness that
could be followed. For thirty years we have wandered in the wilderness.
We are now beginning to get out. But there is only one
road out, and all makeshifts, expedients, profit-and-loss calculations,
but lead into swamps, quicksands, quagmires, and jungles. There
is a highway that will lead both races out into the pure, beautiful
sunshine, where there will be nothing to hide and nothing to explain,
where both races can grow strong and true and useful in
every fiber of their being. I believe that your convention will find
this highway; that it will enact a fundamental law that will be absolutely
just and fair to white and black alike.</p>

<p>"I beg of you, further, that in the degree that you close the
ballot box against the ignorant you open the schoolhouse. More
than one half of the population of your State are negroes. No
State can long prosper when a large part of its citizenship is in
ignorance and poverty, and has no interest in government. I beg
of you that you do not treat us as an alien people. We are not
aliens. You know us; you know that we have cleared your forests,
tilled your fields, nursed your children, and protected your families.
There is an attachment between us that few understand. While
I do not presume to be able to advise you, yet it is in my heart to
say that if your convention would do something that would prevent
for all time strained relations between the two races, and would
permanently settle the matter of political relations in one Southern
State, at least, let the very best educational opportunities be provided
for both races; and add to this an election law that shall be
incapable of unjust discrimination, at the same time providing that
in proportion as the ignorant secure education, property, and character,
they will be given the right of citizenship. Any other course
will take from one half your citizens interest in the State, and hope
and ambition to become intelligent producers and taxpayers, to become
useful and virtuous citizens. Any other course will tie the
white citizens of Louisiana to a body of death.</p>

<p>"The negroes are not unmindful of the fact that the white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
people of your State pay the greater portion of the school taxes,
and that the poverty of the State prevents it from doing all that it
desires for public education; yet I believe that you will agree with
me that ignorance is more costly to the State than education; that
it will cost Louisiana more not to educate the negroes than it will
to educate them. In connection with a generous provision for
public schools, I believe that nothing will so help my own people in
your State as provision at some institution for the highest academic
and normal training in connection with thorough training in agriculture,
mechanics, and domestic economy. The fact is that ninety
per cent of our people depend upon the common occupations for
their living, and outside of the cities eighty-five per cent rely upon
agriculture for support. Notwithstanding this, our people have
been educated for the most part since the war in everything else
but the very thing most of them live by. First-class training in
agriculture, horticulture, dairying, stock raising, the mechanical
arts, and domestic economy would make us intelligent producers, and
not only help us to contribute our proportion as taxpayers, but would
result in retaining much money in the State that now goes outside
for that which can be as well produced at home. An institution
which will give this training of the hand, along with the highest
mental culture, would soon convince our people that their salvation
is largely in the ownership of property and in industrial and business
development, rather than in mere political agitation.</p>

<p>"The highest test of the civilization of any race is in its willingness
to extend a helping hand to the less fortunate. A race,
like an individual, lifts itself up by lifting others up. Surely no
people ever had a greater chance to exhibit the highest Christian
fortitude and magnanimity than is now presented to the people of
Louisiana. It requires little wisdom or statesmanship to repress, to
crush out, to retard the hopes and aspirations of a people, but the
highest and most profound statesmanship is shown in guiding and
stimulating a people, so that every fiber in the body and soul shall
be made to contribute in the highest degree to the usefulness and
ability of the State. It is along this line that I pray God the
thoughts and activities of your convention be guided."</p>

<p>As to the cure for such outbreaks as have recently hurt North
Carolina and South Carolina, I would say that the remedy will not
come by the Southern white man's being merely cursed by the
Northern white man or by the negro. Again, it will not come by
the Southern white man merely depriving the negro of his rights
and privileges. Both of these methods are but superficial, irritating,
and must in the nature of things be short-lived. The statesman,
to cure an evil, resorts to enlightenment, to stimulation; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
politician to repression. I have just remarked that I favor the giving
up of nothing that is guaranteed to us by the Constitution of
the United States, or that is fundamental to our citizenship. While
I hold to these views as strongly as any one, I differ with some as to
the method of securing the permanent and peaceful enjoyment of
all the privileges guaranteed to us by our fundamental law.</p>

<p>In finding a remedy, we must recognize the world-wide fact that
the negro must be led to see and feel that he must make every
effort possible in every way possible to secure the friendship, the
confidence, the co-operation of his white neighbor in the South.
To do this, it is not necessary for the negro to become a truckler
or a trimmer. The Southern white man has no respect for a negro
who does not act from principle. In some way the Southern white
man must be led to see that it is to his interest to turn his attention
more and more to the making of laws that will in the truest sense
elevate the negro. At the present moment, in many cases, when one
attempts to get the negro to co-operate with the Southern white
man, he asks the question, "Can the people who force me to ride in
a Jim Crow car, and pay first-class fare, be my best friends?" In
answering such questions, the Southern white man as well as the
negro has a duty to perform.</p>

<p>In the exercise of his political rights I should advise the negro
to be temperate and modest, and more and more to do his own
thinking, rather than to be led or driven by a political "boss" or by
political demagogues.</p>

<p>I believe the permanent cure for our present evils will come
though a property and educational test for voting that shall apply
honestly and fairly to both races. This will cut off the large mass
of ignorant voters of both races that is now proving so demoralizing
a factor in the politics of the Southern States.</p>

<p>But most of all it will come through industrial development of
the negro! It is for this reason that I have believed in General
Armstrong's theory of industrial education. In the first place, industrial
education makes an intelligent producer of the negro, who
becomes of immediate value to the community rather than one who
yields to the temptation to live merely by politics or other parasitical
employments. In the next place, industrial development will make
the negro soon become a property-holder, and when a citizen becomes
a holder of property he becomes a conservative and thoughtful
voter. He is going to think about the measures and individuals
to be voted for. In proportion as the negro increases his property
interests he becomes important as a taxpayer. When the negro
becomes a large taxpayer, he will see that it is to his interest to
consult with his white neighbor about the measures to be voted for.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
There is little trouble between the negro and the white man as to
matters of education, and when it comes to the negro's business development
the black man has implicit faith in the advice of the
Southern white man. When the negro gets into trouble in the
courts, which require a bond to be given, in nine cases out of ten
he goes to a Southern white man for advice and assistance. Every
one who has lived in the South knows that in many of the church
troubles among the colored people the ministers and other church
officers apply to the nearest white minister for assistance and instruction.
As soon as we have grown to the point where we shall consult
the Southern white man about our politics as we now consult
him about our business, legal, and religious matters, there will be
a change for the better in the situation.</p>

<p>The object lesson of a thousand negroes in every county in the
South owning neat and comfortable homes, possessing skill, industry,
and thrift, with money in the bank, who are large taxpayers and
co-operate with the white men in the South in every manly way
for the development of their own communities and counties, will go
a long way in a few years toward changing the present status of
the negro as a citizen as well as the attitude of the whites toward
the blacks.</p>

<p>In proportion as the negro grows along industrial and business
lines he will divide in his politics on economic issues, just as the white
man in other parts of the country now divides his vote.</p>

<p>In proportion as the South grows in business prosperity the
whole South will divide its vote on economic issues, just as other
portions of the country divide their vote. When we can enact laws
that result in honestly cutting off the large ignorant and nontaxpaying
vote, and when we can bring both races to the point where
they will co-operate with each other in politics in matters of business,
religion, and education, the problem will be in a large measure
solved, and political outbreaks will cease.</p>

<h2>THE ANTIQUITY OF MAN IN NORTH AMERICA.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Dr. CHARLES C. ABBOTT.</span></p>


<p>The claim of satisfactory evidence of the extreme antiquity of
man in the valley of the Delaware River has been soberly discussed
and intemperately ridiculed until the public, both scientific
and general, have become tired of hearing the subject mentioned;
but this is no valid reason why the truth should not be ascertained.
If man in a paleolithic stage of culture did exist on the Atlantic
seaboard of North America, then we have a basis upon which to
build&mdash;a tangible starting point from which to date a history of
human activities on this continent. As it is, we have but an immense
array of facts, largely unrelated, and the greater portion
sadly distorted and misleading because of the reckless theories set
forth with them by their discoverers, and undoubtedly there never
has been, in the whole range of scientific agitation of a simple question,
as great a volume of reckless assertion, illogical deduction,
and disregard of exact statement. The main question was often
wholly lost sight of, and the author's sole purpose that of demonstrating
some one else in error. Predetermination on the part of
many has been fatal to the value of their field work. Convinced
on theoretical grounds, such are necessarily blinded when on the spot
where positive evidence occurs. He who does not desire the object
searched for seldom finds it; and, later in the day, pride declines
to accede to the just demands of candor&mdash;the admission of having
reached a wrong conclusion.</p>

<p>There probably would not have been as much attention paid
to the subject of man's growth in culture on this continent had not
the proposition of a sequence from paleolithic to Indian, with an
intervening period, seemed to necessitate a dating back to the Glacial
epoch, which naturally brought geological erudition to bear
upon the question, and since then, most surprisingly, there has been
confusion worse confounded, rather than a flood of light. Much
has been written, but we can not yet be confident which author is
most nearly correct; and the latest report, showing sad evidences
of haste, is vitiated by evident determination to modernize every
trace of man, whether the facts warranted such procedure or not.</p>

<p>What is held, primarily, to be an evidence of paleolithic man
is a wrought stone implement, that in Europe was characteristic of
his handiwork. Here, in the valley of the Delaware, this same form
of implement has been confidently asserted to be a rejected piece
of stone&mdash;usually argillite&mdash;that failed to lend itself to reduction
to a finished blade or spear point. If this could be established as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
of invariable application, however the supposed "reject" occurred,
then the whole matter would be brought to a quick conclusion. But
the "reject" theory has utterly failed of establishment. The typical
paleolithic implement is not characteristic of the refuse of an
arrow-maker's workshop site, and the familiar arrow points of small
size, nor even the long, thin blades of several times their length,
were reduced from masses greatly larger than the desired form.
The refuse of many a chipping site shows this conclusively; and, as
hundreds of failures demonstrate, many an arrowhead was made
from a pebble but a trifle larger than the finished object.</p>

<p>But admit, for argument's sake, the identity in shape of a "reject"
and a "paleolithic" implement; this does not prove their identity
in age and origin, and it is not an unwarranted or illogical suggestion
to draw a distinction between the two, where the conditions
under which they occur suggest a possibility of diverse history.
Rather than demonstrating that all rudely chipped stones are "failures,"
it should be shown that paleolithic man, as we know of him
in Europe, could not possibly have existed here. This has not only
never been attempted, but the conditions during and immediately
subsequent to the glaciation of the river valley have been asserted,
time and again, to have been favorable for man's existence. Furthermore,
it has not been shown that a typical paleolithic implement
could not have been available on this continent, as it undoubtedly
was in Europe, as an effective weapon, and it must be remembered
that the fauna of the Delaware Valley was, in glacial times, very
like that of parts of Europe in what we may call the reindeer period.
Like conditions may not have produced like results in the case of
early man, but what was practicable in Europe was certainly so in
America, and the question resolves itself into that of determining
if any trace of man that has been discovered in the valley of the
Delaware can be dated back to a time preceding the Indian as he
was when first he came in contact with the European. Did, in other
words, the Indian bring his art with him from Europe or Asia, or
did he experience a growth in culture from paleolithic simplicity
to neolithic complexity?</p>

<p>The whole subject hinges on the distribution of these traces of
man. If from the first day of his occupancy until the European
replaced the Indian the immediate valley of the river had undergone
no change, then the imperishable relics of the first and last
savage would remain associated, and position alone would tell nothing
concerning any particular object's age or origin, but, at the present
day, except the contents of graves, not a stone implement of
the Delaware Indians rests where chance or the intention of its one-time
owner placed it. Indeed, save a few bowlders of the largest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
size, few natural objects on the immediate shores of the river are
as first seen by William Penn and his associates. This fact has not
been duly considered, and unwarranted conclusions have been published
as established truths&mdash;all, of course, eliminating antiquity
from the Indian history of the region. The fact that a so-called paleolithic
implement was found lying on the surface of the river's
shore has resulted in a pen picture of a modern Indian attempting to
fashion a blade and tossing the pebble aside in disgust. Why, indeed,
could not an Indian walk on exposed gravel and pick up a pebble
as well as we can to-day?</p>

<p>There are two considerations to which we must give heed when
this question is asked. We are, in the first place, tacitly informed
that the Indian was given to chipping stone in this haphazard way
to supply a sudden need upon the spot, all of which is not only not
a reasonable assumption, but absolutely incorrect, as argillite bowlders
and pebbles, which are not abundant in the gravels, were not
habitually used, but, instead, the mineral was systematically mined
and selected with skill, so that failures were reduced to a minimum.
Then, again, if the object as found has been lying undisturbed on
the river shore for centuries&mdash;two centuries at least&mdash;why is it that
the chips are not there also? These are never found under such
circumstances. In fact, they are very rarely found at all in the
gravel where the implement itself occurs, and in numbers they exceed
the "reject" or finished object at least as ten to one. Furthermore,
we are asked to believe that the river shore where we find
rude implements is the same to-day as when the Indian wandered
along it centuries ago. Fig. 1 shows clearly how the never-resting
tidal flow wears away the shore, carrying sand and fine gravels from
one point and spreading it elsewhere to form a sand bar, it may be,
and turning the channel from one side of the stream to the other,
and so exposing long reaches of the shore to wasting, that for many
a year had been fixed and apparently secure. Often the mud is entirely
removed from the underlying gravel, and abundant traces
of Indian occupation are brought to light, and, less frequently, so
strong a current attacks a given point that even the gravel is moved
and deep holes are formed, to be filled in time with the wasting
shore from a point perhaps a mile away. This is the story of the
river of to-day, and so it has been for centuries; and yet we are
asked to believe that we can fill the moccasin prints of the Indian
by walking now along the water's edge. I submit that it is asking
a great deal too much.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.&mdash;Wasting River Shore due to Tidal Flow.</span></span>
</div>

<p>It has been suggested that rudely chipped implements, when
found on the gravelly shore of the river, have fallen out from the
bank and rolled down from where they had long been lying. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
is not at all improbable; but how does this modernize the object,
when the gravel extends quite to the surface? The pebbles and
bowlders at the top of the bank are clearly as much a part of the
deposit as are those at its base, and while the surface may be&mdash;is, in
fact&mdash;less ancient than the deeper gravels, still they can not be dissociated;
and it is a significant fact that we find, on the gravel at
the foot of the bluff or other exposure, only the rude argillite objects
at the water's edge or on the flat laid bare at low tide, and not
a general assortment of the Indian's handiwork, including pottery;
and we must not overlook the fact that the "gravel-bed" implements
bear evidence of all the conditions to which the gravel itself
has been subjected&mdash;this one stained by manganese, that incrusted
with limonite; this fresh as the day it was chipped, because lost
in sand and water and not subsequently exposed to the atmosphere;
that buried and unearthed, rolled, scratched, and water-worn until
much of its artificiality has disappeared. The history of almost
every specimen is written upon it, and not one tells such a story
as has been told about it by the advocates of the "Indian-reject"
theory.</p>

<p>Much has been written on the natural history of the gravel that
is so marked a feature of the river valley, particularly at the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
of tide water, and almost every essay differs in more or less degree
from its fellows in the matter of the gravel's age as a well-defined
deposit. Its origin no one can question, nor the agencies by which
it was brought to where we now find it. Ice and water did the
work, nor have they ceased entirely to add to the bulk transported
in strictly glacial times&mdash;perhaps it were better to say in superlatively
glacial time, as the river even now can be positively glacial
upon occasion, as Fig. 2 demonstrates. The main channel has often
been completely blocked with ice and the water forced into new
directions and spread over the lowlands or flats, which it denudes
of its surface soil, and once within recent years the stream found
an old channel, deepened it, and for a time threatened to leave a
flourishing riverside town an inland one. Ice accumulated in this
way year after year must necessarily affect the river's banks, and
yet the extent of "damage" is trifling usually, in comparison with
that of the water, particularly when agitated by passing steamboats
or violent winds; and now, too, the ice of our present winters does
not transport coarse pebbles to any significant extent. I am convinced
of this since the examination I gave acres of ice, when the
river was gorged with it, some years ago. It was possible to walk
for miles over the ice, as shown in Fig. 2, and to see it under exceedingly
favorable circumstances, and a most careful search failed to
reveal a stone larger than a pigeon's egg incased in this ice, which
was all gently floated from far up the stream and stranded here; and
where piled up upon the shores it usually remains until melted, and
really acts as armor plate, protecting the ground from abrasion
when the floods incident to the "break-up" prevail. Such are the
present-day considerations, and they have a direct bearing upon the
question of man's antiquity here because, first, the river valley has
not varied for hundreds of years, except in becoming wider, the
low shores receding, and the stream becoming broader and more
shallow. In earliest Indian times the river was subject to freshets
and ice gorges as now, but never did the water become so dammed
up as to overflow the broad plateaus, areas of glacial gravel, that
at the close of the Glacial period were within the boundary of the
river. The Delaware was a very different stream then&mdash;<i>crescendo</i>
for thousands of years, and <i>diminuendo</i> for thousands since&mdash;until
now it barely hints at what once was. But not even in the height
of its glacial activity was the climate so severe that the waters contained
no fish, nor the forests of the high surrounding hills harbored
no game. Never was it as bleak as the arctic region of to-day, and
as man maintains a footing there, why should he not have done so
here, where life was ever more easily sustained? True; but did he
live here in glacial time?</p>

Reproducing on a small scale the conditions of the Glacial epoch.</span>
</div>

<p>It has been stated in the most positive manner, which only positive
evidence could warrant, that so-called paleolithic implements
have not been found <i>in situ</i> in gravel deposits at a distance from the
river, and such, <i>if there were such</i>, as appeared to be in the gravel,
were recent intrusions. This statement, in its several parts and its
entirety, is absolutely incorrect, and no excuse can be offered for
its publication. It is to be explained, however, because avowedly
predetermined. Wherever the glacial gravel of the Delaware tide-water
region is found, there paleolithic implements occur, as they
also do on and in the surface of areas beyond the gravel boundary.
We accept, notwithstanding the unscientific source of the suggestion,
the statement that post-glacial floods inhumed all traces of
man found beneath the superficial soils, and find that, if these
traces are considered in that light, some mysterious power was behind
the senseless flood, and always buried argillite paleolithic implements
far down in the gravel, and then selected argillite artifacts
of more specialized forms for the overlying sands and reserved the
pottery and jasper arrow points for the vegetation-sustaining soil.
This, as stated, is absurd, but such is the order of occurrence of the
traces of early man in the upland fields, and these are to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
considered carefully before a final conclusion can be reached. The
broad, elevated plateau extending eastward from the present bank
of the river offers facilities for studying the evidences of man's occupancy
in this region such as are to be found in few localities. The
principal reason for this is that almost no local disturbance has occurred
since the original deposition of the sand that overlies the
gravel and underlies the soil. The natural history of these underlying
sands has recently received a good deal of attention, because,
unlike the deeper gravels, there is perfect accord as to the occurrences
therein of artificially chipped objects; and the suggestion that
they are of intrusive origin being set aside as untenable, the geologists
are now divided on the question whether the sand is wind-blown,
a modified dune, and so not necessarily old even in years, or the
result of intermitting overflow of water, usually carrying a considerable
amount of sand and often heavy with washings from some distant
clay bank. The objections to the "eolian" theory are that
pebbles and bowlders, even of considerable weight, are scattered at
all elevations through the sand, and these pebbles, as a rule, do not
present any evidence of exposure to eroding sands, but are smooth
and glassy, or the typical water-worn pebbles of a brook or the river
bed, and more significant is the fact that the sands themselves are of
different degrees of fineness, layer upon layer, and are nowhere clean
or free from clay; and finally the thin layers of clay are clearly continuous
over such extensive areas that in no sense can they be called
segregations of that material. On the other hand, a carefully instituted
comparison of the sand from the surface of the field to its
junction with the gravel proper shows its identity with a deposit
made by water in comparatively recent times. No difference whatever
could be detected. The sand dune, modified by rains and
finally leveled to a plain, presents, in section, no such appearance
as the sands that overlie the gravels of glacial origin. Without
a scintilla of reason, however, many geologists declare that no deposit
of sand can be of any geological significance <i>if it contains traces
of man not clearly intrusive</i>. The latter fact necessitates the former
claim, all of which, I submit, is nonsense.</p>

<p>Fig. 3 illustrates how artificially chipped pebbles occur in this
underlying sand. The upper portion shows the superficial soil removed
to its point of contact with the sand. This is determined by
the change of color from dark brown to light yellowish brown, and
it is generally so very abrupt a change that no doubt arises as to
where the soil ends and the sand begins. The sand proper is shown
by the position of the object&mdash;the measuring rule and trowel. It
will be noticed that the implement is lying flat, as such an object
would almost necessarily be if transported by water, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
perpendicular, as would be the case if it had fallen down some root-hole,
animal's or insect's burrow, or opening in the earth from any
cause, and now obliterated.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p>The presence of these artificial flakes, blades, and other forms
of simple implements can only be explained by considering them
as a constituent part of the containing bed, having been brought
hither by the same agency that brought the sand, pebbles, and clay.
When standing before a newly made section of this implement-bearing
deposit it is easy to picture the slow progress of its accumulation.
The broad plain has been subjected to overflow, now of water
bearing only sand, and then of muddy water; now with current
strong enough to roll small pebbles from some distant point, and
then periods when the sun shone on the new deposit, dried it, and
the loose sand was rippled by the wind. Floods of greater volume
occasionally swept across the plain, and ice-incased pebbles were
dropped upon its surface, and with this building up of the plateau
to a higher level there were also brought to it traces of man's handiwork.
Of this, I think, there can be no doubt now. Years ago
I endeavored to show from the distribution of rude argillite implements
of specialized forms, as arrow points and small blades, trimmed
flakes and scrapers, that these objects were older, as a class, than
jasper and quartz implements and weapons, and that pottery was
made only in the rudest way before "flint" chipping&mdash;jasper and
quartz&mdash;was established. The more exhaustively this subject was
followed up, the proposition became more evidently true, and to-day
it is unqualifiedly confirmed by the results obtained from systematically
digging deeply over wide areas of country. The fact that
argillite continued in use until the very last does not affect this conclusion.</p>

<p>As the high land, now forty or more feet above the river and
beyond the reach of its floods of greatest magnitude, was once continually
overflowed and gradually built up by the materials the
water spread upon it, it is evident that the conditions were materially
different when such things happened from what now obtains,
and the whole configuration of the country to-day points to but the
one conclusion: that these plateau-building floods occurred so long
ago as when the river flowed at a higher level and possessed a greater
transporting power than at present. This, it is true, was long after
the coarse gravel and huge bowlders were transported from the hillsides
of the upper valley, but it was before the river was confined
to its present channel, and more significantly before what may be
called the soil-making period, itself of long duration and the time of
the Indian as such. Not an argillite chip from the sands beneath the
soil but speaks of the distant day when this plateau was an almost
barren plain, and man saw it, roamed over it, and perhaps dwelt upon
it, when but the scantiest vegetation dotted its surface, and only
upon the hills beyond its boundary were there trees and herbage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>Even if we consider the agency of the streams that now are but
insignificant inflowing brooks in spreading, during their freshet
stages, sand over level areas, we must still go back to a time when
they were streams of infinitely greater magnitude than they have
been for many centuries, and before, too, the Indian was a skilled
chipper of jasper and a potter of taste, else why the absence of these
products of his skill in the deeper sands? It matters not how we
look at it, whether as geologists or arch&aelig;ologists, or whether it is
all post-glacial, or the starting point is still so distant as ice-age activities,
the sequence of events is unaffected. We still have paleolithicity
in the gravel, argillite and the discovery of pottery synchronous
with the deposition of the gravel-capping sand, and, lastly,
the Indian.</p>

<p>The record is not a difficult one to read, and never has been, and
the manifold attempts to modernize all traces of man on the eastern
coast of North America can safely be relegated to the limbo of misdirected
energy. Studied in the proper spirit and after the needful
preliminary study of arch&aelig;ology as a whole, the student will find
himself, when in the field&mdash;ever a more desirable place than the
museum&mdash;face to face with evidences of an antiquity that is to be
measured by centuries rather than by years.</p>

<h2>THE USE OF ACETYLENE.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By EDWARD RENOUF</span>,</p>

<p>It is now five years since the use of acetylene as an illuminant was
suggested to the public, and it may be of interest to give a sketch
of what has been done during this time, especially as it seems that
with the year 1899 the tentative period which must characterize every
new industry is in some respects passed, and a period of solid and
well-directed industrial effort, backed by ample capital, has begun.
The knowledge gained during this tentative period by the laboratory
experiments of scientific men, and by the practical work of inventors
and promoters, has made it possible for the industry to enter on its
new phase. To understand its present and to foresee its future importance
it is necessary briefly to review the work of the last years.</p>

<p>In May, 1892, Mr. Thomas Willson, a Canadian electrician, tried
to make the metal calcium in an electric furnace in his works at Spray,
North Carolina, by heating a mixture of lime and coal dust. He
thought that the lime (calcium oxide) would act on the coal (carbon)
to form calcium and carbon monoxide. He did not succeed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
getting calcium, but found in the furnace a brown, crystalline mass,
which was decomposed by pouring water on it, yielding an inflammable
gas. Willson is not a chemist, and he therefore sent specimens
of the material to several men of science to determine its nature. It
was shown to be calcium carbide, a compound of calcium and carbon,
formed by the action of the carbon on the calcium oxide. The
reaction expressed in chemical symbols is CaO + 3C = CaC<sub>2</sub> +
CO. The gas formed by the action of water was acetylene, a compound
of carbon and hydrogen. The reaction is CaC<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O =
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> + CaO; calcium carbide and water form acetylene and lime.
If water enough is added, the lime is slaked, and slaked lime, or calcium
hydroxide, Ca(OH<sub>2</sub>), is formed. Neither calcium carbide nor
acetylene was a new discovery; acetylene was discovered by Edmund
Davy in 1836, and its properties were studied by Berthelot in 1862.
Impure calcium carbide was first made in 1862 by W&ouml;hler, who described
its decomposition by water into acetylene and lime. What was
there new, then, in Willson's discovery? Two important facts: (1) He
was the first to make carbide by a method applicable commercially;
(2) he was the first to make crystalline carbide. W&ouml;hler's carbide
was impure and amorphous; Willson's, nearly pure and crystalline,
so that he succeeded in obtaining United States patents for crystalline
carbide, and, as all carbide made by commercial processes is crystalline,
its manufacture is covered by Willson's patents.</p>

<p>In the same year, 1892, Prof. Henri Moissan, of Paris, announced
the discovery of crystalline calcium carbide. Moissan's discovery,
too, was an accidental one. He was reducing refractory metallic
oxides in an electric furnace made of lime. At the close of the
article in which he reports his work to the French Academy of Sciences
(<i>Comptes Rendus de l'Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise</i>, vol. cxii, page 6,
December 12, 1892) he refers in two lines to the formation of an ill-defined
carbide of calcium by the action of the carbon electrodes on
the lime of which his furnace was made.</p>

<p>As is common with most important inventions, there is a dispute
as to the priority of making carbide by an electric furnace; and the
wonder is, not that there is a dispute, but that there are so few claimants.
A few words of explanation of the electric furnace will show
why. The enormous heat of the electric furnace (2000&deg; to 3000&deg;
C.) is caused by an electric arc, formed by currents playing between
carbon electrodes; carbon is often used in the furnace processes; here
we have one constituent of calcium carbide. Lime, the material for
the other constituent, withstands heat better than any other common
substance excepting magnesia; naturally, inventors would use it, as
Moissan did, as a refractory lining to the furnace. Electric furnaces
were not new. The conditions then were such that the discovery of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
the carbide was fairly forced on experimenters, and, as we have seen,
the discoveries of Willson and Moissan were both accidental.</p>

<p>American priority was claimed by Willson, French priority by
the friends of Moissan, German priority by Professor Borchers, of
Aix-la-Chapelle. Fortunately for Willson, among those to whom he
had sent specimens of carbide was Lord Kelvin, the famous English
physicist, whose reply to Willson, stating that the substance received
was calcium carbide, was dated October 3, 1892, two months before
Moissan's first publication. Borchers's claims are too vague to waste
space on. Willson's priority is now generally recognized excepting
in France. The German Government has acknowledged it, and has
annulled the German patent granted to Bullier.</p>

<p>Commercial carbide is essentially an American discovery, and it
was developed industrially by Willson's associates before industrial
action began abroad. Messrs. Dickerson and Suckert, of New York,
were the first to undertake the industrial liquefaction of acetylene.
Dr. G. de Chalmot, chemist, and Mr. J. M. Morehead, electrician,
worked up the details of the furnace process in the early days at
Spray, North Carolina, and the purity and the yield from a given
weight of material of their carbide have never been excelled, though
cheaper working furnaces are now in use.</p>

<p>Carbides of other metals can be made in the electric furnace, but,
owing to the cheapness of the new material, calcium carbide is the
only one of these which has industrial value as a source of acetylene.
One pound of pure carbide yields 5.89 cubic feet of acetylene.</p>

<p>Thus far carbide has been found industrially valuable for two
other purposes. The one is for carbonizing steel; experiments in
Germany show that iron or soft steel takes up carbon more readily
when it is heated with carbide than when it is heated with coal dust or
charcoal. Some steel works are now using carbide for this purpose.
The other use of carbide is more important. It is found to be a valuable
germicide. It is said to be the most effectual preventive of black
rot, and to destroy the <i>Phylloxera</i>, the two worst enemies of the grape.
The action of the carbide as a germicide depends on its decomposition
by the moisture of the soil, forming acetylene, which kills the
<i>Phylloxera</i>. If the use of carbide on a large scale substantiates the
claims made for it, this is a discovery of vast importance. The ravages
caused by the <i>Phylloxera</i> in the vineyards of southern Europe,
of Africa, and Australia must be ranked as great national calamities.</p>

<p>A temperature ranging from 2000&deg; to 2500&deg; C. (3600&deg; to 4500&deg;
Fahrenheit) is required to make carbide. It is probable that this
temperature can be economically attained only by the electric furnace
using water power as the source of the electric current, and this is
the only method used for making carbide, with the exception of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
Walther process, which does not use electricity but depends on the
intense heat generated by burning acetylene under pressure. In
electric furnaces the formation of carbide depends simply on the heat
of the arc, which fuses the mixture of lime and coke. The latest improvements
on the first very simple forms of furnace have secured
continuity of work and economy of electric energy. In the United
States carbide is made exclusively in the Horry furnace. This
furnace consists of a huge short cylinder or hollow wheel, mounted
to revolve slowly on a horizontal
shaft. The periphery
of the cylinder is closed by
removable cast-iron slats.
As the cylinder is partly revolved
on its axis from time
to time, the slats are taken
off from one side and replaced
on the other, thus
leaving the top always open.
The cylinder is filled on one
side with the powdered mixture
of coke and lime. Into
the mixture two vertical
carbon electrodes project
downward through the open
top of the cylinder. As the
carbide is formed, the cylinder
is revolved, lowering the
mass from the electrodes.
The fused carbide cools, hardens, and is broken off and removed
as it rises on the other side of the slowly revolving cylinder; new
material is constantly fed in to maintain the level around the electrodes.
The process in the Horry furnace is continuous; the furnace
can be run without arresting the current until repairs are necessary.
It is said to combine the different theoretical improvements
referred to, and to reduce the cost of production. The Horry furnace
is in use at Niagara Falls and at Sault Ste. Marie. At St.
Catherine's, Canada, Willson is using his own furnace. Abroad,
the older types of furnace, the Willson, Bullier, and H&eacute;roult, are those
chiefly in use.</p>

<p>The actual ingot of good commercial carbide is nearly pure&mdash;ninety-six
to ninety-nine per cent&mdash;but the ingot is surrounded by a
crust of carbide mixed with unchanged material, containing forty to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
seventy per cent of carbide.
Foreign makers break and
blend ingot and crust to
standard size, the best makers
guaranteeing their carbide
ninety per cent pure,
giving five cubic feet of
acetylene per pound (pure
carbide gives 5.89 cubic
feet). Eight to nine pounds
of carbide per horse power in
twenty-four hours, averaging
five cubic feet of acetylene, is
considered satisfactory work.
The Union Carbide Company,
which controls the sale
of carbide in the United
States, is selling graded carbides
under guarantee, the
first grade being the nearly pure ingot, the lower grade the crust.</p>

<p>As the moisture of the air decomposes the carbide, it must be
broken up as soon as made, and packed in air-tight tin cans, varying
in size from one to four hundred
pounds.</p>

<p>The present price of carbide
abroad averages $96.80
in large lots, and $7.26 per
hundredweight in small lots,
packing included; in the
United States, $70 per ton in
large lots, and $4.50 per hundredweight
in small lots,
packing included. In 1898,
4,650 tons are said to have
been made in the United
States and Canada, and a
much larger amount abroad.
The output for 1899 is estimated
at 12,000 tons for the
United States, with a capacity
in the new works in erection
at Sault Ste. Marie and
at Niagara Falls of 41,000 tons. The new works building in Europe,
to be finished in 1899-1900, have a capacity for making 80,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
metric tons. These figures will justify the statement made at the
beginning of this article, that the new industry has found ample
capital.</p>

<p>The statement is still current that acetylene attacks copper and
brass, forming an explosive compound. This is not true. Exhaustive
experiments by Moissan and by Gerdes, keeping these and other
metals in contact with acetylene for months at a time, have shown
that the metals were not affected. The conditions under which the
explosive copper acetylide is made in laboratories can not well occur
in generators or gas holders. It has been said that acetylene is very
poisonous; the experiments of many observers, and especially those
of Gr&eacute;hant, do not confirm this statement. Gr&eacute;hant experimented on
dogs, causing them to breathe mixtures of acetylene, air, and oxygen,
which always contained 20.8 per cent of oxygen, this being the percentage
of oxygen in pure air. By this device he was able to discriminate
between the poisoning caused by acetylene and suffocation
caused by insufficient oxygen. A mixture containing twenty per
cent acetylene inhaled for thirty-five minutes did not seem to trouble
the animal. A sample of the dog's arterial blood contained ten per
cent of acetylene. A dog which inhaled a mixture containing forty
per cent of acetylene died suddenly after fifty-one minutes, having inhaled
one hundred and twelve litres of the mixture; the arterial blood
contained twenty per cent acetylene. Gr&eacute;hant proved that acetylene
simply dissolves in the blood plasma, while carbon monoxide forms a
compound with the h&aelig;moglobin of the blood. A dog breathing a
similar mixture of air, oxygen, and illuminating gas containing only
one per cent of carbon monoxide quickly showed convulsive movements,
and died after ten minutes; its blood contained twenty-four
per cent of carbon monoxide. Thus acetylene, while slightly poisonous,
is less poisonous than coal gas, and vastly less than water gas,
which contains a high percentage of carbon monoxide.</p>

<p>A pressure of thirty-nine atmospheres and three quarters at 20&deg; C.
converts acetylene into a liquid weighing one third as much as the
same volume of water, while one cubic foot of the liquid when released
from pressure gives five hundred cubic feet of gas.</p>

<p>Hitherto acetylene is used only as a source of heat or as a source
of light; yet with very cheap carbide it would prove useful in many
ways in chemical industry, and its use would have the most wide-spread
effect on industry and agriculture. For instance, a method
of making alcohol from acetylene is patented abroad, and by another
patented process it is proposed to make sugar from acetylene. With
the present prices of alcohol, sugar, and carbide, these processes have
no commercial value.</p>

<p>Acetylene may be made from the carbide in gas works and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
delivered to the consumer through mains like ordinary illuminating gas;
or it may be liquefied at a gas works and delivered to the consumer
in the liquid form under pressure; or the consumer may purchase
carbide and generate acetylene for his own consumption. All three
of these methods are in use.</p>

<p>To understand the attitude of insurance companies and of consumers
toward liquid acetylene it will be well to examine its record
for the last few years. Those interested in methods for liquefying
acetylene, and for reducing the pressure of the liquid at the place of
consumption so that the consumer actually uses it as a gas under a
water pressure of six inches or less, may find processes described in
detail in the Progressive Age, and in other technical journals. Suffice
it to say that the methods in use in this country and abroad are simple
and effective. The purified acetylene is delivered in strong steel
cylinders, which may be placed in a special building or case and need
not be handled by the consumer. It has been proved by the exhaustive
experiments of the eminent French chemist Berthelot that
liquefied acetylene in cylinders can not be exploded by blows or
shocks to the closed cylinder. If it is exploded, however, by causing
a spark within the cylinder, the explosive force is very great, being
about equal to that of gun cotton.</p>

<p>The use of the liquefied acetylene is so simple and clean that the attention
of inventors was first turned to this mode of supply. It may in
future come again into prominence despite the present strong feeling
against it, its use in many cities being prohibited. This feeling was
caused by a number of explosions, accompanied by loss of life. Three
of these explosions occurred in factories for liquefying acetylene;
one in a factory where liquid acetylene regulators were made; several
in buildings of consumers. In October, 1896, Pictet's works in
Paris were wrecked by the explosion of a cylinder filled with liquid
acetylene; evidence proved that the cylinder was held in a vise, and
that the two workmen killed were at the ends of a wrench, closing
or opening the valve, supposing the cylinder to be empty. The explosion
was caused either by a spark from friction in turning the
screw, or by the too sudden opening of the valve and releasing the
pressure, causing a shock sufficient to decompose the liquid. In December,
1896, the works of G. Isaac, in Berlin, were destroyed by an
explosion in the condenser where the cooled acetylene was liquefied
by pressure; Isaac and three workmen were killed. Evidence
showed that through carelessness warm water instead of cold water
was in contact with the condenser, thus warming the liquid and increasing
the pressure to a point which burst the condenser. In December,
1897, the works of the Dickerson &amp; Suckert Acetylene Gas
Liquefying and Distributing Company in Jersey City were destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
by fire caused by the explosion of a cylinder filled through carelessness
of workmen with a mixture of air and liquid acetylene&mdash;i. e.,
with an explosive mixture&mdash;killing the superintendent and a workman.
In the explosion at the regulator factory at New Haven, January,
1895, the valve of the cylinder, on which one of two workmen killed
was working, broke; a large volume of acetylene escaped and ignited
from a lighted candle. In all four cases the explosions were caused
by ignorance or carelessness incident to the beginnings of a new industry,
and could be avoided by experience and skill.</p>

<p>It should be stated that in the explosion at Paris all of the full
acetylene cylinders were dug out of the ruins unhurt. The same was
true at Berlin, where five full cylinders were blown against the
wall of the building by the explosion of the condenser, but did not
explode. At Jersey City sixty filled cylinders were exposed to the
heat of the fire following the explosion; they were fitted with safety
diaphragms of fusible metal; forty-eight remained intact, the acetylene
burning off quietly as it escaped through the fused diaphragm,
and twelve exploded, either on account of imperfection of the diaphragms
or stoppage of the air passage leading from the diaphragm.
The explosions of liquid acetylene in buildings of consumers have
been due in every case to gross carelessness and ignorance on the part
of the consumer.</p>

<p>Although one of the chief points in favor of the liquid acetylene
is its portability, yet it can be shown that it is still easier to carry carbide
to the consumer. One cubic metre of acetylene is compressed to
two litres in liquid form; two litres of carbide weigh 4.44 kilogrammes,
which will produce a cubic metre and a third of acetylene, reckoning
three hundred litres to the kilogramme, which is the average guaranteed
yield of carbide. The light tin carbide cans occupy less space
and weigh less than the heavy steel cylinders, while the generation
of the gas is simple and, with proper generators, perfectly safe. On
the other hand, the generators must be cared for, must often be filled
with fresh carbide, and from time to time must be cleaned. With
the generator system acetylene is as safe as or safer than illuminating
gas. Berthelot has shown that at pressures below two atmospheres a
vessel filled with acetylene can not be exploded by the explosion of a
cap of fulminating mercury within the vessel, nor by heating a wire
which extends into the vessel to a white heat by an electric current.
The reason is that the acetylene can not explode unless it is decomposed
into its elements, carbon and hydrogen; to decompose it requires
a certain amount of energy. While the energy of the glowing
wire or of the exploding cap causes a local decomposition at the point
of contact, it is not sufficient to spread the decomposition further.
Acetylene forms an explosive mixture with air; so does illuminating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
gas. The odor of acetylene is unpleasant; so is the odor of the water
gas used generally in the United States, and the acetylene can be
cheaply deodorized.</p>

<p>As the generator system, then, is the general one, the most important
question to the consumer is what generator to buy, and it is a
perplexing question. The carbide manufacture is so organized that
it is everywhere under the control of powerful and responsible companies
which sell a guaranteed product. The burners now in use
are nearly all good. With generators it is different; the market is
flooded with them at all prices, ranging in value from worse than
useless to very good, as regards safety, economy, and quality of light.
As the generator question is by far the most important and the least
understood in the whole acetylene industry, it will be well to give a
full account of the results of the experiments which have been made
within the last two years on this question. The most exhaustive
experiments are those of the English expert, Professor Lewes, and
his results agree with those of other observers.</p>

<p>Lewes first determined the amount of heat developed by the decomposition
of carbide by water, and the conditions which tend to
lessen or increase the intensity of the reaction. The average result
of the experiments as to the amount of heat was 446.6 calories for
pure carbide, and a little less for commercial carbide (to state this
differently, one pound of carbide, when decomposed by water, gives
off heat enough to raise the temperature of 446.6 pounds of water 1&deg;
C., or to raise the temperature of one pound of water 446.6&deg; C.). As
the intensity of the heat developed determines the highest temperature
attained during the decomposition, and is a function of the time
needed to complete the action, and as the decomposition of carbide
in contact with water is extremely rapid, it is evident that the temperature
developed may be so high as to cause disaster. All the generators
at present before the public may be classified under three
heads: 1. Those in which water is allowed to drip or flow slowly on
a mass of carbide, the evolution of the gas being regulated by the stopping
of the water. 2. Those in which water in considerable volume
is allowed to rise in contact with carbide, the evolution of the gas being
regulated by the driving back of the water by the increase of pressure
in the generating chamber. 3. Those in which the carbide is
dropped or plunged into an excess of water.</p>

<p>The conclusions deduced from a large number of experiments
were that when, as in type 1, water is allowed to drip or flow in a fine
stream upon a mass of carbide, the temperature rapidly rises until
after eighteen to twenty-five minutes the maximum is reached, which
varies from 400&deg; to 700&deg; C. (720&deg; to 1120&deg; Fahrenheit), and it is
probable that in some of the mass the higher limit is always reached,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
as traces of tar are usually found in the residual lime, in some cases
in sufficient quantity to make the lime yellow and pasty, while vapors
of benzene and other polymerization products pass off with the gas.
Leaving the question of temperature in this type of generator, another
important question is the length of time during which the generation
of gas continues after the water supply is automatically cut off. It
is found that gas is evolved with increasing slowness sometimes for
an hour and three quarters after the water supply has ceased, the
total volume of gas so evolved being large.</p>

</div>

<p>The experiments showed that in any automatic generator of this
type the cut-off should be so arranged that one quarter of the total
capacity of the gas holder is still available to store the slowly generating
gas.</p>

<p>The second class of generators bring about contact either by water
rising from below to the carbide suspended in the cage (II, <i>A</i>), or by
a cage of carbide suspended in a movable bell which, as it falls, dips
the carbide into water, withdrawing the carbide from the water as the
excessive generation of gas lifts the bell (II, <i>B</i>). Lewes found that
under certain conditions generators of the type II, <i>B</i> were far worse
than those of type I.</p>

<p>The trials were made with a movable glass bell, with counterweights,
containing a half-pound of carbide. The maximum temperatures
reached in four trials were
703&deg;, 734&deg;, 754&deg;, and 807&deg; C.
Excessive heating took place in
every case; in the last mentioned
the temperature was far above the
point at which acetylene is decomposed
into carbon and hydrogen, a
thin black smoke being formed
immediately around the carbide
while tar vapor poured out. On
removing the residue after cooling
it was found to be coated with soot
and loaded with tar. On several occasions the charge was removed
from the generator just after the maximum temperature was
reached, and was found to be at a bright red heat.</p>

<p>These experiments are of the greatest practical importance. At
600&deg; acetylene begins to polymerize&mdash;i. e., to form more complex
hydrocarbons, which are liquid, or solid, at ordinary temperatures.
Probably in the generator acetylene is first given off so rapidly that
the heat does not act on it, but as decomposition advances into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
center of the mass of carbide, the acetylene generated has to pass
through the external layers, which, as shown, may be at high temperatures,
above that at which acetylene decomposes; thus a considerable
amount of gas is lost, and the tar formed may distill into
the generator and tubes, clogging the tubes. A more serious evil
is the deterioration in the illuminating quality of the gas. Samples
of the gas were taken as the maximum temperature was approached,
and analyzed with this average result: Acetylene, seventy per cent;
other hydrocarbons, eleven per cent; hydrogen, nineteen per cent.
This reduces the illuminating value from two hundred and forty to
one hundred and twenty-six candles. The hydrocarbons consist
largely of benzene, which requires three times as much air for complete
combustion as acetylene does. The best possible acetylene
burner smokes when the acetylene contains benzene.</p>

<p>At first sight these experiments would seem absolutely to condemn
generators of class II, yet the fact remains that some excellent
generators are of this type. Under certain conditions excessive overheating
may be avoided. The rising bell shown in II, <i>B</i> should be
discarded. Generators in which the water rises from below, and
slowly attacks the carbide, can be made safe if the water is never
driven back from the carbide, and the carbide is in separated layers
as in II, <i>A</i>. Under these conditions the water is always in excess at
the point where it attacks the carbide, so that the evaporation, by
rendering heat latent, keeps the temperature down, the temperature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
of the melting point of tin, 228&deg; C., being rarely reached in good
generators where these conditions are met.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the best generators, and the only ones which from
a scientific point of view should be employed, are those of class III,
in which carbide falls into an excess of water. In such generators it
is impossible to get a temperature higher than the boiling point of
water, 100&deg; C., while with a properly arranged tank the temperature
never exceeds that of the air by more than a few degrees. Under
these conditions the absence of polymerization and the washing of
the nascent and finely divided bubbles of gas by the limewater in
the generator yield acetylene of a degree of purity unapproached by
any other form of generator.</p>

<p>When acetylene is burned in air under such conditions that the
flame does not smoke, it has been proved by Gr&eacute;hant that there is
no carbon monoxide among the combustion products; the acetylene
combines with the oxygen of the air to form carbon dioxide and
water (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> + 5O = 2CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O). One cubic foot of acetylene
requires two and a half cubic feet of oxygen. Supposing a room
to have an illumination equal to sixty-four standard candles; this
amount of light from candles would use up 38.5 cubic feet of oxygen
from the air, and would give off forty-three cubic feet of carbon dioxide;
petroleum requires, in cubic feet, twenty-five of oxygen, and gives
off forty of carbon dioxide; gas burned with a flat flame requires
about twenty-five oxygen and gives nineteen carbon dioxide&mdash;with an
Argand flame a little less, while with the Welsbach burner gas requires
only three oxygen, and gives off 1.8 carbon dioxide; acetylene
requires five oxygen and yields four carbon dioxide. So that, light
for light, acetylene fouls the air less than any ordinary illuminant
excepting the Welsbach gas burner. (With incandescent electric
light there is no combustion and no fouling of the air.)</p>

<p>Under the best conditions five cubic feet of acetylene give a light
of two hundred and forty candles for one hour, or we may speak of
acetylene as a two-hundred-and-forty-candle gas. Yet this statement,
though strictly true, may be misleading. When ordinary illuminating
gas is tested with the photometer, it is burned from a standard flat-flame
burner, burning five cubic feet per hour. Now the amount
of light given by such a gas flame is no greater than is pleasant to
the eye; it is true that if we burn five cubic feet of acetylene from
a suitable flat-flame burner, a light of two hundred and forty candles
is given, but it is unfair to take this ratio as representing the actual
relative illuminating value of the two lights, because we neither
need a light of two hundred and forty candles, nor is such an amount
of light issuing from one burner endurable to the eye. One-foot
or one-half foot acetylene burners are used for domestic lighting;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
light from the best one-foot burners averages thirty-two to thirty-five
candles per cubic foot. With acetylene, as with every other illuminating
gas, the smaller the burner and consumption, the less light
per cubic foot of gas is obtained. Another important point is that
while these figures represent the best practical illumination obtained
from acetylene by the burners hitherto in use, the standard flat-flame
burner does not give the best gaslight; with a good Welsbach
burner a cubic foot of illuminating gas will give a seventeen-candle
light as an average. The comparison, to be fair, should be
between acetylene and the Welsbach light.</p>

<p>The reader will ask whether it is not possible to burn acetylene
with other forms of burner, or to use it with Welsbach mantles.
Successful acetylene burners of the Argand or of the regenerative
type have not yet been introduced; but in Germany a new acetylene
burner with Welsbach mantle promises good results. Experiments
in England with an acetylene Bunsen burner and Welsbach mantle
gave a light of ninety candles per cubic foot of acetylene used.
It remains to be seen whether it is necessary to modify the composition
of the mantles because of the intense heat of the acetylene
Bunsen flame, which gives a temperature of 2100&deg; to 2400&deg; C.
(3812&deg; to 4397&deg; Fahrenheit).</p>

<p>It would extend this article to undue length to speak of the various
uses of acetylene as an enricher of other gases, but a mixture of
acetylene and Pintsch oil gas now in use on all the Prussian state
railways deserves mention, as it is a success, and ten thousand tons of
carbide will be used this year for lighting cars by this system. Lewes's
new invention of a very cheap methane water gas which is enriched
by acetylene, carried to the consumer through mains, and burned in
ordinary burners, is also promising.</p>

<p>Insurance and police regulations vary for every country. As a
rule, restrictions are put on the use of liquid acetylene, and on the
amount of carbide to be kept in storage. Generators must stand in
separate buildings, which, in towns, must be fireproof.</p>

<p>The Willson patents cover the manufacture of crystalline carbide
in the United States, Canada, and the South American states; and,
as all carbide made by the electric furnace is crystalline, no carbide
can be made independently of these patents in these countries.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it may be predicted that within the next few years
acetylene will prove a factor in giving us an improved and cheaper
light. Whether this will be an acetylene-Welsbach light or whether
the acetylene will be chiefly used as an enricher of cheaper gases the
future will show.</p>

<h2>THOUGHTS ABOUT UNIVERSITIES.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By WILLIAM KEITH BROOKS</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap lowercase">PROFESSOR OF ZO&Ouml;LOGY IN THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.</span></p>


<p>You are aware that the pedagogue is no longer treated with
that deference and respect which he feels to be due to his
love of learning. Past is all his fame. Past is the day when the
village all declared how much he knew. Nowadays he is accustomed
to be told by the rustics, who once gazed and wondered, that
he is old-fashioned and out of place in our modern world; that he
does not represent the nation; that the love he bears to learning
is at fault; and that the university the people want must be universal
like an omnibus, with a place for all, either for a single square
or to the end.</p>

<p>He is also used to hearing from those successful people of whom
all must speak with reverence&mdash;those who have demonstrated their
superiority by laying their hands on everything they think worth
the getting&mdash;that he is a mere "bookish theorist," and that they are
much more able to show him the path to success than he to tell
them anything to their advantage.</p>

<p>Unless he can minister to their comfort or entertainment, or
make smooth the royal road to learning, or at the very least help
to maintain the patent office, he is told to be content with such
treatment as they think good enough for him, and to keep himself
to his work of teaching the lower classes to be lowly and reverent
to all their betters.</p>

<p>I have been much interested of late by two books on certain
aspects of modern society. One treats of the dangers which threaten
liberal culture and constitutional government, and all the best
products of civilization, through the increasing prevalence of the
belief that our institutions have been <i>devised</i> by a few for their own
selfish ends. So long as men differ in natural endowments the ignorant
and the incapable and the unsuccessful must outnumber those
whose industry and energy and foresight insure success. As those
who have little have always outnumbered those who have much
of the desired fruits of civilization, this writer says that one of the
great questions of the day is whether, in last resort, the world
shall be governed by its ignorance or by its intelligence. He is
alarmed by the diffusion of belief that our established institutions
do not represent the people, and that they are hostile to the best
interest of mankind, and by the prevalence of the opinion that the
true way to reform the world and to secure rational progress is to
intrust the organization and administration of government and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
education and of all matters of public interest and importance to
the majority.</p>

<p>The danger so clearly pointed out is real, beyond question; but
I can not agree with the author that it is exclusively or distinctively
modern. If some in our day interpret the belief that the voice of
the people is the voice of God, as conviction that the loudest voice
is most divine; if they assert that the man with pure and lofty
ideals of education and duty and loyalty is a public enemy; we must
remember that so wise a man as Aristotle taught, in the day of
Athenian democracy, that the man who is virtuous in undue measure
is a moral monster, as justly repugnant to his neighbors as one
pre-eminent in vice.</p>

<p>If the first book calls Aristotle to mind, one must often think
of Jeremiah while reading the second, for its author is a dismal
prophet, who holds that, formidable as unbridled democracy seems,
it is helpless in the struggle with organized plutocracy, and that its
efforts to shake off the restraints and limitations of social existence
can end in nothing but a more crushing despotism, while submission
may bring such rewards of merit for good behavior in the
past and such prizes for good conduct in the future as seem to the
givers to be good investments.</p>

<p>Both writers draw many of their illustrations from the history
of our own country, and they hold that our great political contests
are struggles between those who wish to maintain our institutions
for the sake of what they can themselves make out of them, and
those who seek to wreck the ship of state for very similar reasons.</p>

<p>Some hold that, these things being true, they can show the
learned professor how he may win back, through the struggle between
these two great classes of mankind, some of that confidence
in his wisdom which his predecessors enjoyed. They tell him he
may make his learning represent the people if he will extend his
university until it becomes as universal as the kindergarten, and
that he may at the same time increase his popularity with the select
if he will devote more of his time and more of his energy to that
branch of learning which was in olden times pursued in that secluded
cloister called the campus, although it is better known to the polite
society of our day through the banjo club, the football team, and
the mask and wig club.</p>

<p>If he will cultivate these two fields, and, refraining from the
theoretical pursuit of empty generalities, will enter upon a three
months' campaign of education at some time when men's minds are
stimulated by the heat of faction to welcome calm discussion of the
principles of common honesty and good citizenship, he can not fail
to win the respect and confidence of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p>When I wrote this last sentence I thought that it was all out
of my own head, and I was proud of it; but as I laid down my pen
in my satisfaction for a moment's rest, my eye fell upon this passage
in the prospectus of a new university&mdash;one which is said, in
the prospectus, to be not only universal, but cosmopolitan: "When
a question arises which divides scholars, like the tariff, the causes
and course of the Reformation, money, etc., the student will be referred
to the ablest exponents of the opposing sides."</p>

<p>No professor can plead ignorance of the way to enter this new
career of usefulness. One can scarcely pick up a college catalogue
or a magazine or a newspaper without learning how to make the
university universal. One of the simplest plans, with which all
are familiar, is to send to men with a reputation for learning a ruled
form and a request that each will write, in the proper columns,
the price, publisher, and title of the best book on his own subject&mdash;mathematics,
astronomy, moral science, or whatever it may be&mdash;or,
if he knows of no such book, that he will write one. An accompanying
circular tells how these lists are to be scattered through the
innumerable homes of our land, and how diplomas are to be distributed
as prizes to those who, after purchasing the books, prepare
and submit the most exhaustive permutations of their tables of contents.</p>

<p>Learned men who do not approve this plan are offered a choice
from many others: six-week courses in law, medicine, and theology;
summer schools for the promotion of science and the liberal arts;
questions and answers in the educational column of some journal
for the home; or a national university so universal that it shall supply
lunches and learning for all out of the public chest, with no doorkeeper
to examine passports.</p>

<p>The way to extend the university in this direction is so well
understood that I will turn now to another part of our subject, for
some may be less familiar with our opportunity to construct a royal
road to learning for those who are entitled to use it.</p>

<p>A recent writer on education, who says American universities
impose "upon young men in the nineteenth century a curriculum
devised by dead-and-gone priests for the young men of the twelfth,"
calls upon the teachers of America to reconstruct their curriculum
on psychological principles. I myself am no psychologist, and while
I fail to see how this fact concerns the public, it has recently been
pointed out in print, although no one has ever charged me with
lack of reverence for the psychologist. In truth, he is to me what
the good old family doctor is to many, for I am convinced that it
would be hard to name one among all the educational ills that flesh
is heir to that he would not be able to throw on the spot, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
good collar-and-elbow hold. I have a prodigious respect for those
fine big words <i>curriculum</i> and <i>psychological principles</i>, and I welcome
the plan for reconstructing the curriculum on psychological
principles the more eagerly because it is extremely simple and not
hard to understand, like some psychological utterances. In fact,
it is so very simple and easy that it is sure of enthusiastic indorsement
by innumerable children, for this reformer's plan is neither
more nor less than the abolition of the pedagogue.</p>

<p>"If," he says, "I was director general of education for all America"
(which at the present moment he is not), "I would abolish colleges,
but send American youths to travel for two years in Europe.
In my opinion," he says, "a father who has sons and daughters
of a proper age to go to college will do better by his children if
he sends them for two years to travel in Europe than if he sends
them for three years to an American or English university."</p>

<p>Admirable and simple as is this plan for ascending Parnassus
in vestibuled trains of drawing-room cars, personally conducted by
Grant Allen, this psychologist seems to me to err in thinking it new,
for it was in high favor in England during the reign of that merry
monarch who was always so furious at the sight of books that his
queen, who loved reading, had to practice it in secret in her closet.</p>

<p>Euphranor having asked, in the reign of George II, "Who are
these learned men that of late years have demolished the whole
fabric which lawgivers, philosophers, and divines have been erecting
for so many ages? Lysicles, hearing these words, smiled and
said he believed Euphranor had figured to himself philosophers in
square caps and long gowns; but, thanks to these happy times, the
reign of pedantry was over. Our philosophers, said he, are of a
different kind from those awkward students. They are the best-bred
men of the age, men of the world, men of pleasure, men of
fashion, and fine gentlemen. I will undertake a lad of fourteen
bred in the modern way shall make a better figure and be more considered
in any drawing-room or assembly of polite people than one
at four-and-twenty who hath lain by a long time at school and college.
He will say better things in a better manner, and be more
liked by good judges. I say, when a man observes and considers all
this, he will be apt to ascribe it to the force of truth and the merits
of our cause, which, had it been supported by the revenues and establishments
of the Church and universities, you may guess what
a figure it would make by the figure it makes without them. People
begin to open their eyes. It is not impossible but the revenues
that in ignorant times were applied to a wrong use may hereafter,
in a more enlightened age, be applied to a better."</p>

<p>"The money that went to found the Leland Stanford or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
Johns Hopkins University," says the modern reformer, "would have
been immeasurably better spent in bringing St. Marks at Venice and
the Uffizi at Florence into the lives of innumerable young Americans.
Here, then, is the opportunity for a wiser Cornell."</p>

<p>A few years ago an acquaintance of my own, himself an accomplished
psychologist, brought with him to Washington a young man,
a native of north Greenland, that he might take into his life the
best substitute for St. Marks at Venice that this country affords.
While limited in range, the results were as definite as one could
wish, for two of the most refined delights of our wonderful civilization&mdash;rum
and horses&mdash;were at once taken into the life of Eskimo
Joe with all the fresh enthusiasm of youth. In his boyish impetuosity
he could not see why a hired horse should not have the fleetness
of Santa Claus's reindeer and the endurance of wild dogs; and
as few horses survived the first lesson, the psychologist soon reconstructed
the curriculum, for Joe's progress in rum and oysters was
most gratifying. You who have attended my lectures in anthropology
will remember that Nature has bestowed on the Eskimos
two endowments which are not elsewhere found united, although
they are exhibited separately in high perfection by the anaconda
and the camel. Joe was able to load himself with food and drink
like a pirate ship victualed for a long cruise, and he became so proficient
in three months that a two-year course seemed unnecessary,
so he was shipped off to Labrador at the first opportunity, and was
left there to carry St. Marks at Venice into the homes of Greenland
as best he might. It is clear that our psychological reformer's
plan is not new, but he says our curriculum is some thousand years
behind the times, and he asks, "Will somebody one day have the
wisdom to perceive that the education which sufficed for the medi&aelig;val
England of the Plantagenets is not absolutely adapted to the
America of the nineteenth century?" I myself know so little of
the curriculum of that day that this charge may, for all I know, be
well founded, and if so it were a grievous fault. For all I know
the dead-and-gone priests of the twelfth century may have read
Homer in the original Greek, and carried on their studies in trigonometry
and navigation with the aid of logarithms and the nautical
almanac, although it has come in my way to know something of their
method of teaching zo&ouml;logy, for my studies have led me to examine
a text-book on this subject, which was written early in the twelfth
century for the education of the young Queen Adelaide, who was
married to Henry I of England in 1121. The dedication is as
follows:</p>

<p>"Philippi de Thann into the French language has translated
the Bestiary, a book of science, for the honor of a jewel, who is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
very handsome woman, Aliz is she named, a queen is she crowned,
Queen she is of England, may her soul never have trouble! In
Hebrew in truth Aliz means praise of God. I will compose a book,
may God be with the commencement!"</p>

<p>As a sample of the zo&ouml;logical curriculum of the twelfth century
take this chapter:</p>

<p>"Onager by right is named the wild ass; of it the Physiologus
says, in his speech, when March in his course has completed twenty-five
days, then that day of the month he brays twelve times, and
also in the night for this reason, that that season is the equinox, that
is that night and day are of equal length; by the twelve times that
it makes its braying and its crying, it shows that night and day have
twelve hours in their circuit. The ass is grieved when he makes
his cry, that the night and day have equal length; he likes better
the length of the night than of the day. Now hear without doubt
the signification of this. Onager signifies the devil in this life; and
by March we understand all the time that we have; by the day we
understand good people, by right, who will go in light; and by
night we understand those who were Neros; and by hours we understand
the number of people. And when the devil perceives that
his people decrease, as do the hours which are in the night, after
the vernal equinox which we have in March, then he begins to cry,
to deplore greatly, as the ass does which brays and crys."</p>

<p>One need not go back to the middle ages for a measure of progress,
for all who remember the American college of thirty years
ago know there has been notable improvement in this short time,
and they also know that every change has not been an improvement.
All who are concerned with education see many defects, and wish
to do what they can to remedy them, and to increase the efficiency
and usefulness of our whole educational system in all its branches
from the lowest to the highest, although I believe they still find
much wisdom in the advice of the prophet of old, "that we make a
stand upon the ancient way, and then look about us and discover
what is the straight and right way, and so walk in it."</p>

<p>Many who are now before the public as reformers seem to me
to fall into error through belief that our educational system has
been <i>devised</i> by some one, either in the twelfth century or at some
other time, and that they may therefore hope to devise a better.
All who know that it is a highly complex and delicate organism
which has grown up imperceptibly and naturally in accordance with
many needs, fulfilling many different purposes and acting in many
diversified and far-reaching ways, know also that while reform always
has been and always will be needed, organic change is quite
another matter. They know, too, that a disposition to pull it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
pieces in the interest of some theory or speculation must inevitably
end in disaster, for they must agree with Bacon that "it were good,
therefore, that men in their innovations would follow the example
of time itself, which indeed innovateth greatly, but quietly, and
by degrees scarce to be perceived."</p>

<p>The complaint that learning is no longer treated with due deference
is not exclusively modern, for it was enumerated long ago
among the things that are not new under the sun; and he who for
his own pleasure or distinction devotes himself to work in fields
that yield nothing but the interest of the exploration should look to
his own pleasure for his reward, since learning is no more exalted
by turning it into an aristocratic and exclusive pleasure ground
than by making it a shop for profit. While no weak and foolish
brother of the laboratory should be permitted to think that he belongs
to a favored class or has any claims to support or respect except
for service rendered, it is the duty of our graduates to teach
the world, by the example of their lives, what the work of the university
is.</p>

<p>Lyceum lectures and summer schools and systematic courses of
reading are good things, and the common school and the home are
the foundation of all education. Travel is a most valuable adjunct,
but those who are to profit by it must first know what they go out
to see, "for else shall young men go hooded and look abroad little."</p>

<p>No school or college can improve its work by calling itself a
university, although the prevalence of belief that its work is the
work of a university may bring harm incalculable; for that university
is universal, in the best sense of the word, where students
are inspired with enthusiasm for truth by the example of those
whose minds are "as a mirror or glass capable of the image of the
universal world, and joyful to receive the impression thereof as
the eye joyeth to receive light."</p>

<p>What nobler task can our graduate undertake than to teach
the world that while the benefits which learning confers are its only
claim to consideration, these benefits will cease so soon as they are
made an end or aim? All men prize the fruit; but who else is there
to tell them that the tree will soon be barren if they visit it only
at the harvest, that they must dig about it and nourish it and cherish
the flowers and green leaves? What better service can he render
than to point out that the gifts of learning are like health, which
comes to him who does not seek it, but flies farther and farther from
him who would lure it back by physic or indulgence?</p>

<p>The two authors I referred to at the beginning can not both be
right, and both may be partly wrong, for it is possible that neither
plutocracy nor a democratic majority makes a state. No university<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
need humble itself to seek the favor of either plutocracy or
democracy if its graduates can convince mankind, by their own
lives, that its aim is not to gain deference or success or distinction
or reward of any sort, but solely to propagate and diffuse among
mankind "that enthusiasm for truth, that fanaticism of veracity,
which is a greater possession than much learning, a nobler gift than
the power of increasing knowledge."</p>

<h2>IN THE LITTLE BROOK.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By DAVID STARR JORDAN.</span></p>


<p>Long ago, in the old Devonian times, when life was very leisurely,
all the beasts and people that there were lived in the
sea together. The air was dull and murky on the land. It was so
light that it gave no support to the body, and so those that ventured
about in it had to lie prone on the ground all the time wherever they
went. So they preferred to stay in the water, where motion is
much easier. Then, too, water is so much better to breathe than
air, if one has gills fitted for it! He has only to open his mouth
and the water rushes in. Then he has only to shut his mouth and
the water rushes out backward, bathing his gills on the way. Thus,
the air dissolved in the water purifies all the little drops of blood
that run up and back through the slender tubes of which the gills
are made.</p>

<p>But in those days, besides the gills, some of the beasts of the sea
had also a sac in the throat above the stomach in which they could
stow away air which they took from the atmosphere itself. This
served them in good stead when they were in crowded places, in
which the air dissolved in the water would fail them.</p>

<p>And those which were so provided used to venture farther and
farther out of the water, pushing their way heavily on the ground.
And those which could put forth most effort survived, until at last
their descendants were able to maintain themselves on the land
altogether. These gave rise to the races of reptiles and birds and
mammals, the ancestors of all the land beasts that you know, as well
as men and women and all the monkey people. But it was very
long ago when this happened, and because these ancestors came
finally out of the water they have no part in the story I am trying
to tell to-day.</p>

<p>Those that remained in the water grew more and more contented
with their condition. Because the medium in which they
lived was as heavy as their bodies, they swam without much effort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
and effort not being needed, it was not put forth. As there was
food enough in the water, they did not need to go on land. As
they did not go on land, they did not use their lungs for breathing,
the air sac gradually shrank away, or was used for some other purpose,
and all the parts of the body became adjusted for life in water,
as those of their cousins who left the sea became fitted for the life
in air. Being now fishes for good, all the progress since then has
made them with each succeeding century more and more decidedly
fishy.</p>

<p>And because they are fishes they are contented to live in little
brooks, which would not satisfy you and me at all. But our ancestors
in the early days were more ambitious, and by struggle and
effort won what seems to us a larger heritage.</p>

<p>So it happened one spring when the ice melted out from some
little brook that flows down from somebody's hills somewhere toward
some river that sets toward the Mississippi, the little fishes
began to run.</p>

<p>And first of all came the lampreys, but they hardly count as
fishes, for they have yet to learn the first principles of fishiness. A
fish is a creature whose arms and legs are developed as fins, having
cartilaginous rays spreading out fanlike to form an oar for swimming.
But the lamprey has no trace of arm or leg, not even a bone
or cartilage hidden under the skin. And its ancestors never had
any limbs at all, for the earliest lamprey embryo shows no traces
of them. If the ancestors ever had limbs, the descendants would
never quite forget it. Some little trace would be kept by the clinging
force of heredity, and at some time or another this rudiment
would appear. And the lower jaw they lack too, for that is really
another pair of limbs joined together in front&mdash;as it were, a pair of
short hands clasped together and never unlocked.</p>

<p>But though the lampreys have no limbs and no jaws and are
not fishes anyhow, they do not know the difference, and come up
the brook in the spring, rushing up the rapids, swirling about in
the eddies, just as if they were real fishes and owned the brook
themselves. They are long, slender, and slippery, shaped like eels,
without any scales and with only a little fin, and that along the back
and tail, an outgrowth from the vertebral column. The vertebral
column itself is limp and soft, the vertebr&aelig; only imperfectly formed
and made of soft cartilage. In front the lamprey seems to be cut
off short, but if we look carefully we see that the body ends in a
round disk of a mouth, and that this disk is beset by rows of sharp
teeth. A row of the sharpest of these is placed on the tongue, and
two of these are above the gullet, for the tongue to scrape against
them. And the rest are all blunt and are scattered over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
surface of the mouth, which has no lips nor jaws, but is surrounded
by a belt of fringes. When the lamprey is hungry he puts his
mouth against the side of some fish, exhausts the water between,
and then the pressure of the outside water holds him there tightly.
When this is done, the fish swims away and the lamprey rides with
it, giving no thought to where he is going, but all the while scraping
away the flesh with his rasplike teeth. When he has filed off
enough fish flesh to satisfy his hunger he lets go, and goes off about
his business. The fish, who does not know what hurt him, goes off
to get well if he can. Usually he can not, for the water of the brook
is full of the germs of little toadstool-like plants, and these fasten
themselves on the fish's wounds and make them bigger and bigger,
until at last the cavity of the abdomen is pierced and little creatures
of many kinds, plant and animal, go in there and plunder all this
fish's internal organs, to carry them away for their own purposes.</p>

<p>But when the lampreys come up the April brook it is not to feed
on fishes, nor is it to feed at all. Nature is insistent that the race
should be kept up, and every animal is compelled to attend to the
needs of the species, even though it be at the sacrifice of all else.
If she were not so, the earth and the seas would be depopulated, and
this is a contingency toward which Nature has never looked.</p>

<p>The lampreys come up the stream to spawn, and while on this
errand they fasten their round mouths to stones or clods of earth,
that the current may not sweep them away. When so fastened
they look like some strange dark plant clinging to the bottom of
the brook. When the spawning season is over some of them still
remain there, forgotten by Nature, who is now busied with other
things, and they wear their lives away still clinging&mdash;a strange,
weird piece of brook-bottom scenery which touched the fancy of
Thoreau.</p>

<p>When the young are hatched they are transparent as jelly,
blind and toothless, with a mouth that seems only a slit down the
front end of the body. These little creatures slip down the brook
unobserved, and hide themselves in the grass and lily pads till their
teeth are grown and they go about rasping the bodies of their betters,
grieving the fishes who do not know how to protect themselves.</p>

<p>The lamprey is not a fish at all, only a wicked imitation of one
which can deceive nobody. But there are fishes which are unquestionably
fish&mdash;fish from gills to tail, from head to fin, and of these
the little sunfish may stand first. He comes up the brook in the
spring, fresh as "coin just from the mint," finny arms and legs
wide spread, his gills moving, his mouth opening and shutting
rhythmically, his tail wide spread, and ready for any sudden motion
for which his erratic little brain may give the order. The scales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
of the sunfish shine with all sorts of scarlet, blue, green, purple,
and golden colors. There is a black spot on his head which looks like
an ear, and sometimes grows out in a long black flap, which makes
the imitation still closer. There are many species of the sunfish,
and there may be a half dozen of them in the same brook, but that
makes no difference; for our purposes they are all as one. They lie
poised in the water, with all fins spread, strutting like turkey-cocks,
snapping at worms and little crustaceans and insects whose only
business in the brook is that the fishes may eat them. When the
time comes, the sunfish makes its nest in the fine gravel, building it
with some care&mdash;for a fish. When the female has laid her eggs the
male stands guard till the eggs are hatched. His sharp teeth and
snappish ways, and the bigness of his appearance when the fins are
all displayed, keep the little fishes away. Sometimes, in his zeal, he
snaps at a hook baited with a worm. He then makes a fierce fight,
and the boy who holds the rod is sure that he has a real fish this
time. But when the sunfish is out of the water, strung on a willow
rod, and dried in the sun, the boy sees that a very little fish can
make a good deal of a fuss.</p>

<p>When the sunfish goes, then the catfish will follow&mdash;"a reckless,
bullying set of rangers, with ever a lance at rest." The catfish
belongs to an ancient type not yet fully made into a fish, and hence
those whose paired fins are all properly fastened to the head, as
his are not, hold him in well-merited scorn. He has no scales and
no bright colors. His fins are small, and his head and mouth are
large. Around his mouth are eight long "smellers," fleshy feelers,
that he pushes out as he crawls along the bottom in search of anything
that he may eat. As he may eat anything, he always finds
it. His appetite is as impartial as that of a goat. Anything from
a dead lamprey or a bunch of sunfish eggs to a piece of tomato can
is grateful to him. In each of the fins which represent his arms
is a long, sharp bone with a slimy surface and a serrated edge. These
are fastened by a ball-and-socket joint, and whenever the fish is
alarmed the bone is whirled over and set in place; then it sticks out
stiffly on each side. There is another such bone in the fin on the
back, and when all of these are set there is no fish that can swallow
him. When he takes the hook, which he surely will do if there
is any hook to be taken, he will swallow it greedily. As he is drawn
out of the water he sets his three spines, and laughs to himself as
the boy pricks his fingers trying to get the hook from his stomach.
This the boy is sure to do, and because the boy of the Mississippi
Valley is always fishing for catfish is the reason why his fingers are
always sore. The catfish is careless of the present, and sure of the
future. After he is strung on a birch branch and dried in the sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
and sprinkled with dust and has had his stomach dug out to recover
the hook, if he falls into the brook he will swim away. He
holds no malice, and is ready to bite again at the first thing in sight.</p>

<p>The catfish uses his lungs as an organ of hearing. The needless
lung becomes a closed sac filled with air, and commonly known
as the swim bladder. In the catfish (as in the suckers, chubs, and
most brook fishes) the air bladder is large, and is connected by a
slender tube, the remains of the trachea, to the &oelig;sophagus. At
its front it fits closely to the vertebral column. The anterior vertebr&aelig;
are much enlarged, twisted together, and through them passes
a chain of bones which connect with the hidden cavity of the air.
The air bladder therefore assists the ear of the catfish as the tympanum
and its bones assist the ear of the higher animals. An ear
of this sort can carry little range of variety in sound. It probably
gives only the impression of jars or disturbances in the water.</p>

<p>The catfish lays her eggs on the bottom of the brook, without
much care as to their location. She is not, however, indifferent to
their fate, for when the little fishes are hatched she swims with
them into shallow waters, brooding over them and watching them
much as a hen does with her chickens. In shallow ponds the young
catfishes make a black cloud along the shores, and the other fishes
let them alone, for their spines are sharp as needles.</p>

<p>Up the brooks in the spring come the suckers, large and small&mdash;coarse,
harmless, stupid fishes, who have only two instincts, the one
to press to the head of the stream to lay their eggs, the other to
nose over the bottom of the stream wherever they go, sucking into
their puckered, toothless mouths every organic thing, from water
moss to carrion, which they may happen to find. They have no other
habits to speak of, and when they have laid their eggs in a sandy
ripple they care no more for them, but let go of life's activity and
drop down the current to the river whence they came. There
are black suckers and white suckers, yellow ones, brown ones, and
mottled, and there is more than one kind in every little brook, but
one and all they are harmless dolts, the prey of all larger fishes, and
so full of bones that even the small boy spits them out after he has
cooked them.</p>

<p>Then come the minnows, of all forms and sizes, the female dull
colored and practical, laying her eggs automatically when she finds
quiet water, and thinking no more of them afterward. The male,
feeble of muscle, but resplendent in color, with head and fins painted
scarlet or purple, or silver white, or inky black, as may be most
pleasing to his spouse. His mouth is small and without teeth, for
he feeds on creatures smaller than fishes, and his head in the spring
is covered with coarse warts, nuptial ornaments, which fall off as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
soon as the eggs are properly disposed of. In the little brook which
comes to my mind as I write two kinds of minnows come up the
stream together before the others realize that it is verily spring.
The one is small, dainty, translucent, and active, swimming free
in the water near the surface and able to take care of itself when
pursued by a sunfish or bass. Along the side of its body are two
black stripes not quite parallel, and between and below them the
silvery scales are flushed with fiery scarlet. The fins are all yellow,
with scarlet at base, and as the male passes and repasses before the
female all these colors, which she has not, grow brighter than ever.</p>

<p>The next is a larger fish, clumsy in form, hugging the bottom
as he swims. The whole body of the male is covered with coarse
white warts, and across each fin is a bar of black, white, and orange.
This minnow feeds on mud, or rather on the little plants which grow
in mud, and his intestines are lengthened out proportionally. In
fact, they are so long that, to find room for them, they are wound
spool-fashion about the air bladder in a way which happens to no
other animal.</p>

<p>Of the other minnows, the one attracts his female by a big, jet-black
head; another by the painted fins, which shine like white
satin; another by his deep-blue sheen, which is washed all over with
crimson. In fact, every conceivable arrangement of bright colors
can be found, if we go the country over, as the adornment of some
minnow when he mates in the spring. The only exception is green,
for to the fishes, as to the birds, green is not a color. It only serves
to cover one, while the purpose of real color is to be seen.</p>

<p>And there are fishes whose colors are so placed that they are
hidden from above or below, but seen of their own kind which looks
on them from the side.</p>

<p>The brightest fishes in the world, the "Johnny darters," are
in our little brook. But if you look at them from above you will
hardly see them, for they are dull olive on the back, with dark spots
and dashes like the weeds under which they lie. The male is only
a little fellow, not so long as your finger and slim for his size. He
lies flat on the bottom, half hidden by a stone, around which his
tail is twisted. He will stay there for hours, unseen by other fishes,
except by his own kinsmen. But if you reach down to touch him
with your finger he is no longer there. The tail straightens out,
there is a flash of blue and scarlet, and a foot or two away he is
resting quietly as before. On the bottom is his place, and he
seems always at peace, but when he moves his actions are instantaneous
and as swift as possible to a creature who lives in the water.
On the bottom, among the stones, the female casts her spawn.
Neither she nor the male pays any further attention to it, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
the breeding season the male is painted in colors as beautiful as
those of the wood warblers. When you go to the brook in the
spring you will find him there, and if you catch him and turn him
over on his side you will see the colors that he shows to his mate,
and which her choice through ages has tended to develop in him.
But do not hurt him. He can only breathe for a moment out of
water. Put him back in the brook and let him paint its bottom
the colors of a rainbow, a sunset, or a garden of roses. All that can
be done with blue, crimson, and green pigments in fish ornamentation
you will find in some brook in which the darters live. It is in
the limestone brooks that flow into the Tennessee and Cumberland
where they are found at their brightest, but the Ozark region comes
in for a close second.</p>

<p>There will be sticklebacks in your brook, but the other fishes
do not like them, for they are tough and dry of flesh, and their
sharp spines make them hard to swallow and harder still to digest.
They hide beneath the overhanging tufts of grass, and dart out
swiftly at whatever passes by. They tear the fins of the minnows,
rob the nests of the sunfish, drag out the eggs of the suckers, and
are busy from morn to night at whatever mischief is possible in
the brook.</p>

<p>The male dresses in jet-black when the breeding season is on,
sometimes with a further ornament of copper-red or of scarlet.
The sticklebacks build nests in which to hide their eggs, and over
these the male stands guard, defending them with courage which
would be dauntless in any animal more than two inches long. Very
often he has to repel the attacks of the female herself, who, being
relieved of all responsibility for her offspring, is prone to turn cannibal.
Even the little dwellers of the brook have their own troubles
and adversities and perversities.</p>

<p>Last of all comes the blob, or miller's thumb, who hides in darkness
and picks up all that there is left. He is scaleless and slippery,
large of head, plump of body, and with no end of appetite. He
lurks under stones when the water is cold. He is gray and greenish,
like the bottom in color. He robs the buried nests of eggs,
swallows the young fishes, devours the dead ones, and checks the
undue increase of all, not forgetting his own kind. When he has
done his work and the fall has come and gone, and the winter and
the spring return, the brook once more fills with fishes, and there
are the same kinds, with the same actions, the same ways, and the
same numbers, and one might think from year to year, as the sun
is said to do, that these were the selfsame waters and the selfsame
fishes mating over and over again and feeding on the selfsame food.</p>

<p>But this is not so. The old stage remains, or seems to remain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
but every year come new actors, and the lines which they repeat
were "written for them centuries before they were born." But
each generation which passes changes their lives just a little, just
as the brook and the meadow itself is changing.</p>

<h2>WHITE WHALES IN CONFINEMENT.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By FRED MATHER.</span></p>


<p>The dolphin family (<i>Delphinid&aelig;</i>) contains nine genera, with
only one species in each, but the most interesting one is the
white whale (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i> of Pallas, or <i>D. catodon</i> [Linn.]
of Gill), because it is the only one that can be kept in confinement
and its habits observed under semi-domestication. It has fallen to
my lot to care for several of these animals in confinement, and to
have a chance to note their peculiarities.</p>

<p>"The Great New York Aquarium," at Broadway and Thirty-fourth
Street, New York city, was built by Messrs. Coup and Reiche,
and opened in 1876. Mr. Butler was the superintendent. I supervised
fish culture, and when not otherwise engaged made collections
of fishes and invertebrates in Bermuda and in other parts. In 1877
I had charge of their branch aquarium at Coney Island. At both
places we had many white whales at different times, for the management
would keep whales penned up on the St. Lawrence River
to replace those which died, and would never show more than two at
a time, claiming that they were rare animals and only to be had
at "enormous" expense. The aquarium was a private concern;
admission fifty cents; and as the owners were W. C. Coup, a former
circus proprietor and once the business manager of Barnum's Circus,
and Henry Reiche, an animal dealer, who would sell you
giraffes, elephants, or white mice, the attractions were duly exaggerated
by the press agent, no matter what the facts might be. This
is why we kept a reserve stock of white whales. It would never
do to have the public know that they were common during the summer
in the St. Lawrence, and when one was getting weak another
would be sent down, and the public supposed that the same pair was
on exhibition all the time.</p>

<p>This species is common in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and
Arctic Oceans. According to the late Prof. G. Brown Goode,
"stragglers have been seen in the Frith of Forth, latitude 56&deg;, while
on the American coast several have been taken within the past decade
[1880] on the north shore of Cape Cod. They are slightly abundant
in New England waters, but in the St. Lawrence River and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
coast of Labrador are plentiful, and the object of a profitable fishery.
They abound in the Bering and Okhotsk Seas, and ascend the Yukon
River, Alaska, to a distance of seven hundred miles. The names in
use are beluga and whitefish among whalers, porpoise, dauphin blanc,
marsouin or marsoon in Canada, and keela luak with the Greenland
Eskimos" (Fisheries Industries).</p>

<p>The white whale grows to be sixteen feet long; we never had
one over ten feet in length, but they were billed, showman fashion,
to be much longer. An adult will yield from eighty to one hundred
gallons of good whale oil, besides several gallons of more valuable
oil from the head which is used on clocks and watches under the
trade name of "porpoise-jaw oil," which is sent in a crude state to
manufacturers on Cape Cod, who refine it and free it from all tendency
to gum. The skins make a leather that is waterproof and
stands more hard service than any other known leather. Large
quantities of it are sent to England and made into "porpoise-hide
boots" for sportsmen, and in Canada the hides are converted into
mail bags. The flesh is eaten to some extent by the fishermen, fresh,
salted, and smoked.</p>

<p>Zach. Coup said: "I have eaten the fresh steaks several times,
and found the meat a fair substitute for beef when the choice was
between fish and bacon as a continuous diet, down on the islands
where these three things were the only possible variation in the line
of animal food, and a very limited choice in the vegetable line, comprising
dried beans and rice, for when I was with them there was
a scarcity of potatoes for seed, and canned goods had not attained
their present popularity, even if these poor fishermen had been able
to buy them."</p>

<p>The fat, oily blubber is an overcoat, a nonconductor of heat, and
is between the muscle and the skin, as is largely the case with the
hog, and, like the latter animal, there is savory muscle which may
be cut into succulent steaks below it.</p>

<p>At first the white whales were not in my care, but, being strange
animals, were watched with curiosity. The whale tank was as nearly
circular as a twenty-sided tank could be whose glass plates were
four feet wide with iron standards between, making a pool of about
thirty feet in diameter. The pool was of cement and tapered down
to an outlet about three feet below the floor, for drainage, and on
the floor the cement basin arose two and a half feet, while the panes
of one-inch glass were six feet high, with the water line two feet
below the top of the glass. This gave the spectators a view of the
animals below water, and of their backs as they came up to blow.
The white whale and the harbor porpoise (<i>Phoc&aelig;na brachycion</i>),
known as the herring-hog, etc., do not make as much of a "spout"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
as the larger whales do; they roll up and exhale either less strongly
or with less water over the blow-hole than their larger relatives.
They merely send a mist into the air which can not be seen at a distance
of a thousand yards, while the "blowing" of the larger whales
may be seen for miles. Half a century ago we boys were taught
by the text-books that the whale&mdash;there was only one mentioned&mdash;drew
in water through its mouth, strained out the jellyfishes and
other life, and then ejected the water, after the manner of a fire
engine, through the top of its head. That this nostril, equipped with
the best water-tight valve ever invented, enabled an air-breathing
mammal to exhale and inhale, without getting much water into its
lungs, we never suspected. If we thought about it at all we looked
at the whale as a fish, having gills somewhere, and let it go at that.
As our laws speak of "whale fisheries" and "seal fisheries" in connection
with these great aquatic mammals, it would be just as correct
to speak of all animals which frequent the water as "fishes," and
legislate on the "muskrat fisheries," "mink fisheries," etc.; there is
really no difference.</p>

<p>I have seen newspaper reports that about thirty years ago a white
whale, brought there by a Mr. Cutting, lived in captivity in Boston
for two years. Beyond the fact that one was brought there by a
Mr. Cutting, and was on exhibition about that time, is all that I have
been able to learn, and it is doubtful if it lived one year (see Fisheries
Industries, section 1, page 19). One was exhibited at Barnum's old
museum, at Broadway and Ann Street, New York, that is said to
have lived nine months and was then burned up when that building
burned, in March, 1868. As these animals only come into the St.
Lawrence, where all live ones have been captured, in May and June,
there is no reason to doubt that it did live in confinement for nine
months, but none that have been exhibited since that time have survived
more than half as long, and I have had personal knowledge of
every one since Barnum's.</p>

<p>Coup's Broadway Aquarium opened on October 11, 1876&mdash;too
late to get a white whale that year. But early next spring Mr. Coup
sent his brother to the St. Lawrence River for specimens. This
brother, "Zach.," had never seen a whale, but he had full instructions
concerning their care from Professor Butler, who had charge
of the one at Barnum's Museum. There was an air of mystery
about the expedition, and in May "Zach." brought a solitary specimen
and at once went for more. The town was billed, the daily
press was worked in true circus fashion, the crowd came and expressed
various opinions. Standing by the tank, I heard strange
comments:</p>

<p>"Do you call that little thing a whale?" This to an attendant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir, it's a white whale from the northern coast of Labrador,
the only one ever captured or ever seen by the oldest whaleman. It
was reported to have been seen near the entrance to Hudson Bay, and
Mr. Coup fitted out an expedition and captured it at an expense of
over one hundred thousand dollars." He had evidently been reading
what the press agent had stuffed into the newspapers.</p>

<p>The visitor took another look and remarked: "The papers said
it was twenty feet long; I should think it might be six feet, but no
more."</p>

<p>"Well," answered the attendant, "water is mitey deceivin', an'
that whale is more'n three times as long as it looks. The fact is,
the papers did report it to be longer than it is, for when we drew
off the water to clean the tank yesterday we put a steel tape over
the whale and it measured just nineteen feet eleven inches and a half."</p>

<p>Then a rural couple came, and she remarked: "Oh, I'm so glad
we came here, and can tell the folks that we've seen a real live
whale!"</p>

<p>"Lucy," said he, "this city is full of all kinds of cheats, an'
I don't believe that thing is alive more'n Methuselah is; it's some
indy-rubber contraption with clockwork in it that makes it go
round and puff in that way."</p>

<p>After the season for hatching trout and salmon was over, in
April, I was detailed to build a branch aquarium at Coney Island,
with instructions to construct a whale tank the first thing, in order
to be ready for the next arrivals. I employed a maker of beer vats,
and he brought three-inch planks for the bottom, staves eight feet
high, and iron for hoops. The tank was to be twenty-five feet in
diameter, with a "chime" nine inches below the bottom, making
the tank seven feet deep inside. It was to set with its top eighteen
inches above the soil, which was to be the water line, giving the
whales five feet and a half of water&mdash;little enough when we realize
that a ten-foot animal has a diameter of nearly three feet. Heavy
timbers were laid under the bottom of the tank, carefully leveled, for
no weight can be borne by the staves in a tank of that size.</p>

<p>All this was planned, as well as the engine and pumps, and was
well under way, when I received an order from Mr. Coup to go to
Quebec and bring down two whales while Zach. went for more.
Then I learned the secrets of the live white whale trade. The first
whale had been kept back until it could be delivered at night, and
its transportation was a mystery intended to arouse the curiosity of
the public.</p>

<p>At the railroad station at Quebec two boxes were turned over to
me. They were about fifteen feet long, four feet wide, and four
feet deep. They were upholstered with "bladder wrack," a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
soft cushion, and in each box a white whale lay on these pneumatic
cushions. A plug in the bottom of each box had let the water out
while the boxes were being lifted by the rope handles on the sides,
but when on the cars the plugs were replaced and water to the depth
of a foot was poured in; this served to keep the under parts moist,
while frequent sponging or the use of a dipper served to keep the
skin from drying. The nostril, or "blow-hole," needed the most
attention, for it has a valve which must not be allowed to get even
partially dry, and a saturated sponge was kept suspended over this
all the time during the journey by rail to New York.</p>

<p>The white whale is a very timid animal, and comes up the St.
Lawrence in May and June, when the young are brought forth; it
is believed that they then go to the river to avoid their enemies,
among which is the "killer" or orca whale. Their food, according
to Professor Goode, is "bottom fish, like flounders and halibut, cod,
haddock, salmon, squids, and prawns." From my knowledge of
this whale in confinement I am surprised at the above list, for those
under my observation not only preferred live eels, but could not
swallow one whose diameter was over one inch, and it was difficult
to get quantities of eels as small as three quarters of an inch in
diameter, especially when an adult whale would consume about
twenty pounds in a day. When larger eels were placed in the tank
they would be taken out dead in a day or two with their sides
scratched and torn by the small teeth of the whale which had failed
to swallow it. We tried other food, for eels are quite expensive in
New York city, costing fifteen and eighteen cents per pound, but
the whales refused small flatfish, flounders, etc., and the only other
food they ate was small tomcods. They refused dead herrings
and all fish that were cut in pieces.</p>

<p>The animals are captured at the small French fishing village of
Rivi&egrave;re l'Ouelle, on Isle aux Coudres, seventy miles below Quebec,
where life is as primitive as it was two hundred years ago in this,
one of the oldest of Canadian settlements. Luke Tilden, one of
our aquarium men, who went up with Zach. Coup, told of the capture
of the whales, and the following is from notes taken by me as Luke
told it: The men all fish and the women do a little gardening, but
their harvest is the marsouin, a name common to the white whale and
to the black porpoise. A fair white whale will weight eight hundred
pounds and yield nearly one hundred gallons of oil worth fifty cents
per gallon, so that when they trap twenty in a season it means prosperity
to the colony; in 1874 they took one hundred, but the catch
has fallen off since. "When we reached the island," said Luke, "we
went straight to Father Alixe Pelletier and donated ten dollars to
the Church for prayers for our success, and it was well invested.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
The good old man is the head of that colony and keeps everything
straight. In 1863 there was an epidemic of indifference to the
Church, and the men went to the bad, got drunk, fought, fished on
Sundays, and reviled the priest, withholding all dues to him. Then
he said, 'God is angry with you, and to punish you will send no
more marsouin until you repent.' They laughed at him, and for
three years no marsouin came to them, and they were very poor.
They went to the father on a Christmas day and implored him to
intercede for them, and he did. The next spring there was a great
catch of marsouin, and the men have remained faithful since.</p>

<p>"The tides here rise and fall some twenty feet, and the whales
are trapped in an inclosure made of poles, the entrance to which is
closed when a school enters. The pound is about a mile square, and
is made of slim poles put two feet apart, space enough to let a whale
through, but they will not attempt it. The tide falls and leaves
them on the mud, quaking with fear. When we want live ones the
boxes are made, padded with seaweed, shoved out over the mud,
tipped on one side, and the whale rolled into it, where its struggles
soon put it on an even keel, and then it gives up and does nothing but
breathe as the boxes are taken on board a schooner for Quebec."</p>

<p>I was fortunate in getting the above story from Luke Tilden,
for a few weeks afterward he died in the aquarium; and Zach. Coup
would tell nothing that could be relied on, not even to the locality
where the whales were caught.</p>

<p>The white whale is the only one of its tribe that can be captured
in the manner related, because of its cowardly timidity. The harbor
porpoise, or "herring-hog," would jump nets and break barricades
or die. It would not bear the confinement of an aquarium, for it
would leap out of the tanks or dash its brains out in trying to do
so; but, once placed in a tank of either salt or fresh water, the white
whale starts to circle it, always to the left, with the sun, and contentedly
blows at intervals of from five to fifteen minutes, and seems
as contented as a canary bird in its cage.</p>

<p>The whale does not always swim in circles to the left when free,
and why it does so in confinement is a question. I merely assert the
fact. Perhaps wiser men know why perfectly still water in a washbowl
will rotate to the left with an accelerated motion when the
plug is withdrawn, but I do not. As the motion to the left is invariable
there must be a rule for it, but, granting that this motion has
some relation to the motion of the earth, the question of how this
affects the voluntary movements of an animal remains to be answered.
I have watched over a dozen white whales in captivity, dumped into
tanks from the most convenient side without regard to the direction
of their heads, and every one turned and circled to the left. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
question arises, Why do they do this? At the new aquarium now
at Battery Park, New York city, the big sturgeon always circles to
the left except when feeding.</p>

<p>The two whales at Coney Island were good-sized ones, nearly
ten feet long, and they raced around, side by side, and played for
nearly two hours before they began to take the eels which had been
in the tank several days, although the large mammals had been without
food for at least seven days. On the way down I had noticed a
difference in the sound of their breathing, that of the female being
sharp and clear, while her mate seemed to have a hoarseness, and
occasionally gave something like a cough. I called attention to this
and told Mr. Coup that the animal had some lung trouble. He consulted
a man who professed to know about these animals, and then
reported his opinion that the cough was nothing to fear, "merely a
little water in the blow-hole."</p>

<p>"This may be true," I replied; "I'm not a medical man, but I've
heard many consumptives cough, and that whale imitates them. I
doubt if it lives a month."</p>

<p>It lived just twenty-six days after its arrival at Coney Island.
The last five days of its life it took no food, and its labored breathing
was annoying to all who knew the cause of it. Then came a touching
display of affection. The female slackened her pace day by day
to accommodate it to that of her constantly weakening companion,
and as the end neared she put her broad transverse tail under his and
propelled him along. He stopped breathing at 10 <span class="smcap lowercase">A. M.</span>, but his mate
kept up her efforts, occasionally making a swift run around the
tank, as if to say, "Come, follow me," and then slowing up at his
side, resumed the work of sculling him along, as before. Rude men
expressed pity for the living one, and after my men had rigged a derrick
and hoisted her mate from the pool she would rise higher out
of water when she came up to blow, remembering that he had gone
out over the top of the tank. An autopsy by local physicians, whose
names have been forgotten, assisted by a medical student then in my
employ, now Dr. J. R. Latham, 126 West Eleventh Street, New York
city, disclosed the fact that the whale died of pneumonia.</p>

<p>A white whale which reached the Broadway aquarium about
July 1st, after mine came, lived seven months, dying January 28,
1878. My whale was either diseased when captured or took a cold
at Isle aux Coudres. The New York one was sound all summer, and
I told Mr. Coup that it might live for years, but the artificial heat
of the aquarium in winter was not what a subarctic animal could
endure, and it succumbed as most of Peary's Eskimos did in New
York last winter. The autopsy on this whale was performed by
Dr. F. D. Weisse, professor of practical and surgical anatomy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
medical department of the University of the City of New York,
assisted by Prof. J. W. I. Arnold, of the same university, and Dr.
Liautard, superintendent of the Veterinary College. They agreed
that pneumonia was the cause of death, induced by a change of temperature
of the water in which the animal had been kept. The
official measurements of this female specimen, whose organs were
kept in the two institutions named, were: nine feet six inches from
snout to tail tips; three feet between tips of caudal fins, with a body
breadth of twenty inches and a head breadth of thirteen inches.
The lungs, weighing twenty-two pounds, presented on dissection the
appearance of having been affected with chronic catarrhal pneumonia.
The liver weighed nineteen pounds. The four stomachs
were all free from any trace of previous disease.</p>

<p>In looking up the life history of the white whale when opportunity
offered, during the last twenty years I have consulted many
old whalemen, and they all say that whales of all kinds take their
babies on their flukes and scull them along as my female sculled
her dying and dead partner. This must be a fact, for the little one
could never swim with its parent. But another question arises: Is
this purely a female instinct to provide for its young, which was, in
the case of my pair, developed into a desire to preserve a companion?
or, in other words, would a male have done this, or would a female
have done it if she were free and had other companions? Was it
love for her mate, or a feeling of selfishness at her lonely position?
My female was afterward sent to England in the old transportation
box, and was nine days without food, for they will not swallow food
in transit, and it lived four days in London, clearing more than
enough to pay for the animal and all expenses.</p>

<p>When the free aquarium at Battery Park, New York city, was
opened, December 10, 1896, there was talk of getting white whales
the next spring, but there was no way to employ men to go for them
at a stated salary, as they would have to pass a civil-service examination
and become regularly appointed employees of the city. In this
emergency Mr. Eugene G. Blackford came forward and advanced
the money for the expedition, and it started early in May. On
June 4th Professor Butler delivered a pair of them to the superintendent,
Dr. Bean. I was aware of their coming, and was at the
aquarium, and so was Dr. Latham. The male was lead-colored,
was said to be a year and a half old, and was nine feet long.
The female was of the usual cream-color, ten feet and a half long,
and was said to be a year older than her mate. It is known that
young and immature specimens are darker than adults, but I am
skeptical about the ages, especially as there is a half year credited
to each at the exact time the young are brought forth, and do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
know on what the ages are based further than that the young are
darker in color for a time.</p>

<p>"How does the breathing of the big one sound to you?" the
doctor asked.</p>

<p>"Like ours at Coney Island that died from lung trouble," I replied,
"and I would not have brought that animal down unless it was
the only one to be had during the season."</p>

<p>"I think I'll give her about ten days to live," replied the doctor.</p>

<p>As these were not my whales, I declined to talk of their prospects
of life to several reporters who knew me, and the whale in question
died of pneumonia on June 11th, just a week after its arrival in New
York, and several days before the trained ear of Dr. Latham had
allotted its span of life.</p>

<p>The male came to its death by an accident at 9 <span class="smcap lowercase">P. M.</span> on June
24th, just twenty days after arrival. An eel got into its blow-hole
and it drowned. According to an account published in the New
York Sun of Monday, July 26, 1897, said to be obtained from Dr.
Tarleton H. Bean, director of the aquarium, the whale "was as
healthy a one as ever spouted until late on Friday afternoon, the
24th, when one of the keepers noticed that something was wrong.
His attention was attracted by the loud wheezing that accompanied
each blow that the whale made when he came up for air. The
wheezing could be heard all over the aquarium. Dr. Bean was sent
for. He was certain that the whale's lungs were all right. He
cited a fact, known to the custodian and to all the keepers, that the
mammal for the past month had remained under water a little
longer after he came to the surface to blow. This convinced Dr.
Bean that the whale's lungs were sound and that some other cause
of illness must be found."</p>

<p>Then the whale coughed out a piece of an eel that it had bit in
two, and as it came up to blow again there was another piece hanging
from the blow-hole which could not shut, and so let water into the
lungs. Dr. Bean ordered the water drawn off the tank in order to
get at the animal, but a former superintendent, who had planned the
tanks, had put in such small drainage pipes that by the time the
water was drawn down so that the men could get at the whale it
was dead.</p>

<p>I do not believe that a white whale lived two years in Boston,
because this subarctic animal could not endure the extremes of Boston's
temperatures without contracting lung disease in some form.
Think of such an animal living through climatic conditions that an
Eskimo can not stand, and in a public institution where thousands of
people are vitiating the air!</p>

<p>Animals which live wholly in water are more susceptible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
changes of temperature than those which live on land. The white
whale can be kept the year round in New York city if it can have
a refrigerating plant to give it the temperature which it needs, and
proper food.</p>

<p>We bring polar bears to New York which suffer in summer, if
not in our comparatively mild winters, and tropical animals which
barely survive, but these land mammals are not so susceptible to
climatic influences as are the fishes and the purely aquatic mammals,
like the whales. These can never be kept long by the crude means
which have been employed. From the purest air they have been
changed to the more or less vitiated air where thousands of human
beings are crowded and in a temperature which is unnatural. If
we would keep them we must give them better chances for living
than in open tanks in the summer temperature of New York.</p>

<h2>UNUSUAL FORMS IN PLANTS.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By BYRON D. HALSTED.</span></p>


<p>The unexpected is apt to occur. Along with the regularity in
living things, which we call "uniformity of Nature," there is
so strong a tendency to vary that one almost expects to find a turn
in the avenues of life sooner or later, and that gradual or sudden, as
the case may be. We will not stop to discuss the open question of
whether we are possessed by an inherent quality of variation, or as
creatures of circumstances, subject to the controlling forces of our
environment.</p>

<p>Yesterday while looking at a row of seedling peaches, all from
the same lot of pits, one of the miniature trees was found to be
bronze or copper colored throughout. This set me to thinking.
Here was a "sport," as it is termed, and if I take good care of the
abnormity, bud it into common stock, etc., the landscape architects
and ornamental gardeners may thank me for the novelty that
will please their wealthy patrons.</p>

<p>Leaving aside the abnormal as met with in the animal world, for
much of it is more painful than otherwise to contemplate, let us
glance at some of the unusual things occurring among plants.</p>

<p>One first thinks of some strange forms in leaf, and if the eyes
are opened to them they may be met with upon every hand. The
"four-leaf" clover is lucky perhaps only because the finder is
sharper-eyed than others, and stands a brighter chance of seeing
success as it crouches almost invisible in the wild grass, the tilled
field, or wherever the eyes may be set to find it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p>The child who brings me the oddities of vegetable forms is knowing
in the normals of his class of curiosities, or else he would not
see the novelties from the finding and exhibiting of which he gains
so much pleasure. The person who is familiar with the striking
beauty of the cardinal flower (<i>Lobelia cardinalis</i>) is the one who
rejoices at the variations that may occur in the tints of the bright
corolla. His delight would reach a high pitch should the conspicuous
spikes be found upon dry ground, and not by the bank of some
stream half hidden by the overhanging grass. But should the wandering
plant display white flowers, then an albino of a most interesting
kind has been met with, and some reason for it is sought in
the unusual locality. Only a few days ago a white variation of the
<i>Lobelia syphilitica</i>, cousin to the cardinal, was seen by the writer
treasured in the Botanical Garden at Cambridge, Mass., and it called
to mind the rage for pink water lilies, that twenty years ago were
only met with wild in ponds at Plymouth, Mass. I asked an expert
recently if there was any call for the pink or "Plymouth" lilies, and
he informed me that the fad had died out with the transplanting
and widespread culture of the pink "sports" of the nymph&aelig;a ponds.</p>

<p>Abnormal colors in flowers are among the most common freaks
in wild plants, and none are more frequent than the albinos. One
could fill a page with instances of this sort. Some of our most common
weeds, as the moth mullein (<i>Verbascum blattaria</i>), have a large
percentage of the plants with white blossoms, and the patches of the
white interspersed with the normal yellow-flowered plants in poorly
kept meadows and neglected land has led the writer to gather seed
of each to test the truth of the opinion that the white strain may be
transmitted to the offspring, but the proof is not yet at hand.</p>

<p>The writer knows where there is a patch of the hound's tongue
(<i>Echinospermum</i>) with a good sprinkling of plants producing white
corollas instead of the normal deep maroon. The two colors make
a good subject for students who are gaining an elementary knowledge
of the stability of species, and the range of striking variations
that must be allowed for them.</p>

<p>Next to the albinos the instances where the floral parts approach
leaves in size and color are the most common. A few weeks ago
while passing through a field once devoted to corn, but now overgrown
with weeds, and therefore of special interest to a botanist,
my eyes fell upon a daisy plant all the heads of which were with
olive-green ray flowers instead of the ordinary pure white ones.
These rays were smaller than the normal and quite inclined to roll,
as shown in Fig. 1, and form quills, as seen in some of the fancy
chrysanthemums. By the way, our common field daisy is a genuine
chrysanthemum, and that which is produced in one species under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
the guiding, fostering hand of the skilled gardener was here shadowed
forth in the field of waste land.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illo_091-fig1.jpg" width="400" height="323" alt="Fig. 1.&mdash;Green and Normal Oxeye Daisy Heads." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.&mdash;Green and Normal Oxeye Daisy Heads.</span></span>
</div>

<p>A week or so later, while going through a similar field in an
adjoining county to the one where the daisy freak was found, I came
upon nearly the same thing as seen in the heads of the "black-eyed
Susan," or cone flower (<i>Rudbeckia hirta</i> L.). Here were the two
leading weedy daisies, the white and the yellow, the former coming
to our fields from the East and across the sea, while the latter, as a native
of our Western prairies, journeys to make a home here and help
to compensate by its pestiferous presence for the vile weeds that
have gone West with the advance of civilization. Both of these
daisies revealed that tendency in them to vary in their floral structures
that if made use of by the floriculturist might result in forms
and colors as attractive and profitable as met with in their cousins
the chrysanthemums of the Orient.</p>

<p>Perhaps the season which we have had, with its excess of moisture
and superheat, has made the abnormal forms more abundant
than usual. The even current of life has been met by counter
streams, so to say, and the channels were broken down. In walking
through a meadow in early June it was a common thing to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
the spikes of the narrow-leaved plantain (<i>Plantago lanceolata</i> L.)
branched and compounded into curious shapes. Some of the normal
and malformed spikes are shown in Fig. 2.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illo_092-fig2.jpg" width="600" height="418" alt="Fig. 2.&mdash;Malformed Heads of Plantago Lanceolata." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.&mdash;Malformed Heads of Plantago Lanceolata.</span></span>
</div>

<p>As a tailpiece to this portion of the subject it is a pleasure to
introduce a freak among the native orchards, as shown in Fig. 3.
A word of explanation is needed of the normal form of the lady's
slipper here shown. As found in the moist woods, the plant above
ground consists of two leaves and a single pink and strange-looking
blossom terminating the stalk. This is the rule, and it has been
strictly adhered to, so far as the writer knows, for centuries with a
single exception, and that exception is the one here presented. It
is as remarkable as a double-headed dog, and as difficult of explanation
as the twin thumb.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 453px;">
<img src="images/illo_093-fig3.jpg" width="453" height="600" alt="Fig. 3.&mdash;A Twin-Flowered Cypripedium
Acaule (Ait.)." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.&mdash;A Twin-Flowered Cypripedium
Acaule (Ait.).</span></span>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the best way is to make no attempt to account for the
freak, and leave the subject open for those who have a gift of insight
into the secrets of the abnormal and the unexpected. Other
species of cypripediums regularly bear more than one flower; this
one may have done so in former ages, and here is the link that binds
our pretty unifloral species to its remote and possibly extinct ancestor.
On the other hand, a double-flowered form is possibly in embryo,
and before the next century closes the <i>Cypripedium acaule</i>
Ait. may need to have its description changed so as to embrace two
flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span></p>

<p>The influence of moisture, heat, and light is very great upon
vegetation, and one only needs to observe the same species of plant
as grown in a moist, shady place, as compared with the ones that
are located in the full sun where the soil is dry. Size and shape of
parts, and even their color and the surface, are different, and this
all leads us up to the cultivated plants where variation is the rule
and constancy the exception.</p>

<p>Among wild plants where similar surroundings obtain for all
members of the species the albino is noted, and any replacement of
stamens by petals, as in the wild buttercup, is the rare exception.
But the cultivated plants have led a charmed life, and we scarcely
wonder that the plants in the bed of sweet peas or gladiolus, canna
or dahlia, are as diverse in form and color as the pieces in a crazy-bedquilt.
Man, with all his ingenuity and skill, has been at work
molding the plant clay made plastic by generations of special culture.</p>

<p>In one sense the greenhouse, the garden, orchard, and even the
cultivated field are all dealing with monstrosities. The well-filled
horticultural hall at a State or county fair is a vast collection of
unnatural curiosities&mdash;that is, they do not occur in Nature, but are
truly the creations of the
mind of man as worked out
along lines of vegetable
physiology and stimulated
plant production. For dinner
this very day the writer
ate a slice of a modern watermelon.
What a triumph
of horticultural art was exhibited
in that giant fruit,
each seed of which was filled
with the accumulated tendencies
of a generation of
high breeding! There was
represented the influence of
soil and selection, of crossing
and of culture, until the wild
melon, which none of us sees
or cares to see, is gone and
a special creation takes its
place, with its great demands
upon any one who would attempt to grow it to perfection.</p>

<p>The art of breeding might possibly have deprived it of seeds
had there been some other convenient method for propagation, as is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
true of many of our tree fruits, the navel orange being a striking
example. Along with the absence of seeds and the presence of fine
flavor there is truly a monstrous form, in that one orange is within
and at the "navel" end of the other.</p>

<p>Should we glance at some of our garden vegetables, as, for example,
the cabbages in their various races, every one will be struck
with the strangeness, to say the least, of the forms produced. In
contrast with the head of the true cabbage, where leaf is folded
upon leaf until a mass of metamorphosed foliage as large as a half
bushel is produced, there is the cauliflower, with the edible substance
stored in a fleshy inflorescence that has lost its normal function
and become truly monstrous. Were it not so tender and delicate
a food we might be disposed to smile at the absurdity of the
whole thing, or at the kohl-rabi, with its turniplike bulb in the stem
just above the surface of the ground. It is certainly a plastic species
that will give such diverse and fantastic forms&mdash;so far from the
wild state, and for that reason so useful to man.</p>

<p>In the same manner a comparison of our orchard fruits with the
forms from which they came would lead to the thought that man
has made them to his liking, and not for service to the plant species.
They are abnormal, judged by all standards in Nature; monstrous
in size and in many cases have lost their essential structure as seed-producing
organs.</p>

<p>Coming to the ornamental grounds, the disguises are largely
swept away, and there is but little hope of judging what the original
plants may have been from which have descended the favorites of
the flower bed and the conservatory. Species have been split into
a thousand and one varieties, each with its peculiarities and each
with the potency for greater deviation. Where shall we cast the
line and land an example? The rose show of June is only surpassed
by the chrysanthemum exhibition in autumn. There must be the
new sorts brought out each year, whether the fancy be for a special
shade or color or a striking new shape of bud or form of bloom.
Would you realize what a novelty means to those in the craft who
watch a group of carnation growers as they hang over the exhibit of
a "new" rival, and consider all the merits and defects of the candidate
for a certificate?</p>

<p>All the beauties of the flower garden are so familiar to us that
it is not expected that they will be considered unnatural. If the
hydrangea makes a panicle larger than it can bear, man helps it out
with a string or stake, for by overdoing it is not undone any more
than is the coddled peach tree held up at fruiting time by a dozen
poles, or the forced lily with a weak back supported upright by an
artificial green stem at church on Easter morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>

<p>But even here there are monstrosities in the true sense. The
asparagus or sweet potato stem occasionally broadens out into a
ribbon, and it passes as an abnormity. The same thing takes
place in the flower cluster of cockscomb (<i>Celosia cristata</i>), and if
it failed to produce a strange fan-shaped and highly colored and
crested top the owner would complain that her seed had given her
only an inferior pigweed, and therefore not come true to name.
The attractiveness of the cockscomb resides in the strange habit the
plant has of broadening the upper end of the flower stalk out into a
form that is truly monstrous. And this brings me to speak of a form
that attracted my attention during the present season, samples of
which are shown in Fig. 4.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 501px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.&mdash;Monstrous Blossoms of Foxglove.</span></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p>The striking feature of the specimens of foxglove (<i>Digitalis
purpurea</i>) under consideration is the production of an enormous
somewhat bell-shaped flower at the extremity of the long racemose
inflorescence, and at a time when only a few of the lowermost blossoms
upon the stem have opened. The normal digitalis flower has
a large pendant purple corolla much spotted upon the middle lobe
of the larger and lower lip. On the other hand, the truly monstrous
flowers, two to three inches across, are borne terminally and are
quite uniformly bell-shaped, with the lobes from twelve to fourteen
and spotted evenly over all the surface. The four stamens
of the normal flower have increased to twelve in three examined and
to thirteen in another. These stamens are normal in size and situated
upon the corolla tube, except that there is no indication of their
being in long and short pairs.</p>

<p>The single pistil is many times enlarged in the monstrous blossom&mdash;in
one instance two thirds of an inch in diameter for the ovary.
Within the outer ovarian wall there was a circle of five petaloid
pistils, some showing the placent&aelig; and ovules intermixed with the
pink and purplish petaloid expansions.</p>

<p>Within the circle above mentioned there was a second pistil,
tipped like the original with petal-like lobes instead of a stigma.
The column was found so closely built up that the parts would not
separate, and a cross-section was made through it, which showed that
the pistil had a greenish central stalk around which the ovarian
cavities were scattered quite irregularly, all bearing numerous
ovules. In the flowers with twelve stamens there were four tips to
the stigma, and the eight cavities were to be distinguished in the
ovary, although they were not arranged in any regular order and
not uniform in size. In short, the transections of these resembled
the seed cavities seen in a slice of a large tomato of the "trophy"
or "ponderosa" type.</p>

<p>The florists' catalogues advertise in a few instances this "<i>Digitalis
monstrosa</i>," and it is presumed that the specimens from which
the engraving was made were from a packet of this "strain" of
seed. As but a small percentage of the plants in the bed examined
were monstrous, letters were addressed to some German growers of
the seed, with questions as to this commercial monstrosity. One
reply contained the statement that the form known as "monstrosa"
had been in the market about ten years, and that about fifty per
cent of the plants produce the strange terminal flowers. Another
correspondent recalls the form in question as having been catalogued
for more than forty years, and that it is described in a work upon
gardening published in 1859, in which it states that the seed of this
variety must only be gathered from the capsules of the monstrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
flowers in order to preserve the abnormity. Concerning this last
my correspondent said that it is all the same whether the seed is
taken from the capsules of monstrous flowers or from the whole
spike. Seed taken in this way will give from twenty-five to thirty-five
per cent of the monstrous flowers, but the ratio varies from
year to year.</p>

<p>There are some advantages to the floriculturist in the monstrous
form as the first bloom in it is uppermost and very conspicuous,
while in the normal form the blooms appear from below upward,
and the drooping tip of the spike is the last to produce flowers. The
case in hand is a remarkable deviation from the type in many ways,
but most interesting of all is the fact that floriculturists have by
selection developed a variety that, in a packet of a hundred seeds,
is quite certain to give some plants of the type "monstrosa," which
it bears as its trade name.</p>

<h2>MALAY LITERATURE.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By R. CLYDE FORD.</span></p>


<p>The Malay has a literature peculiarly his own, and in it comes to
light all that subtle appreciation of Nature which marks him as
a <i>Naturmensch</i>, but not a savage. This lore of his race he carries
mostly in his memory, for to reduce it to writing has been, until
recently, a task at once laborious and scholarly, and the ordinary
Malay, living in the ease of perpetual summer, is neither. Still, there
are dog-eared old manuscripts which circulate from one village or
<i>campong</i> to another, and these are often read aloud in the evenings
to eager companies. And it makes a scene never to be forgotten,
to see a dozen people seated in the shadows around some old man
and to listen to the mellow cadences of his voice as he reads to them
a tale of the olden time, of the great days of his race, before the
foreigner's ships had scared the fish from the bays or turned them
into noisy harbors; the sparkling stars peep through the ragged, whispering
fronds of the palm trees, the yellow light of the <i>damar</i> torch
shines on eager faces, crickets chirp in the grass, and from afar comes
the booming of the sea borne on the soft breath of the night wind.</p>

<p>Malay literature, like most literatures, has had an ancient and a
modern period. In the former we behold a primitive people dominated
by Sanskrit life and civilization, and naturally enough the
literature of this time is mostly translations of Sanskrit poems and
romances, or at least productions inspired by such, and full of allusions
to Hindu mythology. Probably to this early time may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
traced such works as <i>Sri Rama</i>, a free translation of the <i>Ramayana</i>;
the <i>Hikayat Pancha Tantra</i>, an adaptation of the <i>Hitaspod&ecirc;sa</i>;
<i>Radin Mantri</i>, a history of the love affairs of a Javan royal prince;
the <i>Sha&iuml;r Bidasari</i>, an epic; and several other such epics and romances.</p>

<p>One must not think that the language of these works is old-fashioned
or obsolete, as Beowulf and Chaucer are to us, or the
Niebelungen Lied in German. On the contrary, they are full of
Arabic words and many other marks of recent composition; but it
is the matter, the conditions of life described, the evident antiquity
of the very feeling of the productions, that lead one to refer them
to the early period.</p>

<p>There are also some works that are genuinely Malay in origin
and inspiration, and probably of a date that would put them between
the ancient and modern periods. Of such is <i>Hong Tuah</i>, a story of
a prince of Malacca who was a kind of King Arthur of his day. This
work exists in several manuscripts, some of which are in England,
one in Leyden, and one or two in the East Indies, and the date of the
oldest is not before 1172 of the Hegira. Considering the fact that
the year 1317 of the Mohammedan era does not commence till May
12, 1899, we thus see that many of the manuscripts of Malay literature
are of no great antiquity. Another of these intermediate works
is the <i>Sejarat Malayu</i>, or Malay Annals, which narrates the history
of the Malays of Malacca, and their heroic defense against the Portuguese
in the year 1511. It is divided into chapters, and is about
the only notable historical composition in the language.</p>

<p>The modern period is that period which marks the domination
of Islam in the far East, the period in which the Malay mind has
adjusted itself to a new faith and a new education. It is hard to
tell when Mohammedanism first obtained a real foothold among
the Malays, but probably not much before the fourteenth century.
However, the conquest when once effected was complete, and to-day
the people of Tanah Malayu are among the strictest followers of
the Prophet.</p>

<p>In a certain sense this period of the literature has been fruitful,
but not so fruitful as the former one. Originality has been checked
and imagination deadened, and the result is seen in a loss of sprightliness
and vivacity. Works of morals and philosophy and compilations
of Mohammedan law, have flourished. Still, we find some prose
works of this period which are commendable; they even have some
of the spirit of the earlier writings by which, no doubt, they were
inspired; among these may be mentioned the <i>Tadju Elsalathin</i>, or
Crown of Kings, by a mendicant monk, and the <i>Hikayat Sultan
Ibrahim</i>, a religious romance of some beauty and pathos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p>

<p>Within the last seventy-five years the prose literature has received
some notable additions through the writings of Abdulla bin
Abdulkadir, a famous <i>moonshi</i> of Singapore, who attained to some
distinction under the Straits Government, being sent once or twice
on missions to native states. He was born in Malacca toward the
close of the last century, of Arab-Malay parentage, and received the
ordinary education of a Malay lad of good family. After Singapore
was founded, in 1819, he moved thither, where he thenceforth spent
most of his life. His most important works are the <i>Hikayat Abdulla</i>,
an autobiography, the <i>Pelayaran Abdulla</i>, an account of his trip for
the government to Kelantan, and a narrative of his pilgrimage to
Mecca made in the year 1854.</p>

<p>Without a doubt Abdulla was the most cultured Malay who ever
wrote. In his capacity as teacher he was often called upon to help
missionaries with their translations of the Bible into Malay; though
a devout Mohammedan, he was more than ordinarily liberal in belief,
and quite willing to see the contest between Christianity and
Islam go on fairly and on its merits. He once assisted a Mr. Thompsen,
of Malacca, in translating portions of the Scriptures, but it was
a thankless task, for the missionary was obstinate, and thought he
knew more about the language than the <i>moonshi</i> himself. As a
result, such wretched Malay got into the work that Abdulla felt
called upon in his autobiography to set himself right before the
world. This is what he says:</p>

<p>"... But let it be known to all gentlemen who read my autobiography
that where there are wrong expressions or absurd Malay
phrases in Mr. Thompsen's translation they must consider well the
restraint put upon me, wherein I could neither add nor subtract a
word without the concurrence of Mr. Thompsen. Now, because
of all the circumstances mentioned here, let no gentleman rail at my
character, for I was merely Mr. Thompsen's <i>moonshi</i> or instructor.
I acknowledge I am not destitute of faults, but truly by God's grace
I am able to distinguish between right and wrong in all that relates
to the idiom of the Malay language, for I have made it my study. I
did not attain it by hearing, nor by the way, nor in the bustle of
the crowd."</p>

<p>But it is in poetry that we must look for whatever of originality
and beauty there is in Malay literature, a fact not to be wondered
at if we consider the softness and mellifluence of the language, which
lends itself easily to the requirements of rhyme and rhythm. Two
chief forms of poetry are recognized&mdash;the <i>pantun</i> and the <i>sha&iuml;r</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pantun.</span>&mdash;The <i>pantun</i> in Malay literature corresponds to
the lyric verse of Western lands. It consists of one or many
quatrains, as the case may be, the lines usually from ten to twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
syllables in length. However, if worse comes to worst, the Malay
poet with true poetic license suits himself in preference to others, and
frequently employs as few as six or as many as thirteen syllables in
a line. The length of a syllable is determined by tonic accent, but
penult syllables not ending in a consonant are long, those ending in
silent <i>i</i> are short. But here, too, the Malay often departs from
theory, and his rhymes, instead of being always exact, are constructed
for the eye and not for the ear; and as for the short lines, they have
to be drawled out into a legitimate scansion. The lines are not
written one below another as with us, but the second opposite the
first, the third under the second and opposite the fourth, and so on.</p>

<p>The <i>pantun</i> is much employed in improvisation, the stanzas being
recited alternately by the two taking part. To the Malayan
mind the beauty of this kind of verse lies in the artistic perfection
of each quatrain by which it is made to veil some charming metaphor,
which in turn serves in the last two lines to point a moral or express
some sentiment of love or friendship, depending on the allegory of
the preceding. To illustrate:</p>

<p>In poetry of more pretentious style, and in improvisations also,
each stanza contains a key-word or line which becomes the text, so
to speak, of the next. As artificial and unnatural as this may seem,
it is, nevertheless, an ingenious way of keeping the thread of one's
discourse when other inspiration fails. The best results of Malay
verse come from it. A beautiful example may be cited from the
Asiatic Journal of 1825:</p>

</div></div>

<p>Adelbert von Chamisso, the German poet, who has another claim
to fame, however&mdash;his scientific career was charmingly described in
the Popular Science Monthly for December, 1890&mdash;includes in his
published poems three songs, In Malay Form, for which he doubtless
obtained inspiration during his voyage to the far East in 1815 to 1818.
They are so faithful in spirit and style to their source that we can
not forbear quoting one in translation. It is called The Basketmaker,
and is in the form of a dialogue, each stanza having the usual
"key" line:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Sha&iuml;r.</span>&mdash;The <i>sha&iuml;r</i> is very different from the <i>pantun</i>; the latter
is lyric, the former epic in its nature; the <i>sha&iuml;r</i> may be heroic or
romantic, the <i>pantun</i> never. However, it employs the same measure
as the <i>pantun</i>, but all the lines of each stanza rhyme, instead of by
pairs, as in the quatrains of the lyric verse. It is to the <i>sha&iuml;r</i> that we
must look for the really great works of Malay poetry, where some are
bold enough to declare we may find passages of Homeric beauty. The
most famous works of this nature are <i>Radin Mantri</i>, <i>Kin Tambouhan</i>,
and <i>Bidasari</i>. The first two of these tell the story of the love of a
prince of the royal house of Nigara for a maiden of his mother's
court. It is a beautiful tale, abounding in parts of striking eloquence
and pathos, and the characters are strong and well portrayed.</p>

<p>The <i>Bidasari</i> is the longest poem in the language, and typically
Malayan. Its author is unknown, likewise the time and place of its
composition. The only hint as to the writer is in the opening lines:</p>

<p>"... Listen to this story of the history of a king in a province
of Kambayat. A fakir has turned the narrative into a poem."</p>

<p>And again at the conclusion, where it says:</p>

<p>"This poem is weak and faulty because my knowledge is imperfect.
My heart was troubled&mdash;for that reason have I written it. I
have not made it long, because I was sad; but I have finished it and
thereby obtained many blessings."</p>

<p>Internal evidence, however, indicates that the poem is old, of a
time long before the Europeans first came to the East, possibly before
the Mohammedan conquest. It shows plainly the influence of Hindu
theology, yet in the customs and scenes described, and the mode of
life and the manner of thinking, it is essentially Malay, and so
worthy, perhaps, of a somewhat extended notice.</p>

<p>"There was once a king, a sultan, handsome, learned, perfect;
he was of the race of noble kings; he caused the land of merchants
and strangers to be swallowed up. From what people of his time
say of him he was a valorous prince who had never yet been thwarted.
But to-morrow and the day after to-morrow are uncertain." Such is
the beginning of Canto I, as given in the French translation by Louis
de Backer. The king marries, but just as joy and happiness are to
be his, a griffinlike <i>garuda</i> sweeps down upon his land and ravages
it. Terrified, the monarch deserts his throne, takes his royal consort
and flees for his life. On the flight the queen gives birth
to a child, which, however, must be deserted, much to the mother's
grief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span></p>

<p>In Canto II a rich merchant is introduced&mdash;a man whose goods
and treasures are immense, whose slaves numerous, prosperity constant,
but who, alas! is childless. One morning as he and his wife
are walking by the side of a stream they discover a boat drifting
near them, and in it a child of such radiant beauty that they are
moved to adopt it.</p>

<p>The lord of the region is Sultan Mengindra, whose queen is beautiful,
but unhappy, through constant looking forward to the day
when she shall be displaced by some woman more beautiful than she.
At last she has a costly fan made, and sends out spies to offer it for
sale in every village and town, but not to tell its price. If they
discover a woman of rare beauty they are to return and notify her.</p>

<p>In course of time the spies come to the old merchant's home, and
see Bidasari, the handsome adopted child. After some delay she
is brought to court, where she has to undergo much studied ill treatment
from the jealous queen. By a subterfuge the girl escapes and
is then removed by the merchant to a secret place in the desert.</p>

<p>Canto III tells how Sultan Mengindra goes to hunt in the desert,
and there finds a sleeping beauty whom he awakens and consoles with
the music of a <i>pantun</i>.</p>

<p>In Canto IV the story returns to the King of Kambayat. He
and his queen have succeeded in reaching a distant part of their
kingdom, but the fate of the young princess whom they so shamefully
deserted oppresses them. Finally, the king's son, stirred by his
mother's tears, sets out to search for this sister whom he has never
seen. In his search he meets with Bidasari's adopted brother, who
detects the resemblance between the young prince and his sister.
Together they go to obtain audience of the sultan and Bidasari, who
is now queen.</p>

<p>Canto V. Convinced that the story of the prince is true, Sultan
Mengindra dissuades him from returning, but bids his minister write
a missive in letters of gold and dispatch it at once, with presents and
jewels, to the King of Kambayat.</p>

<p>In Canto VI we have the last chapter. The King of Kambayat
receives the letter, which, however, makes no mention of Bidasari,
and at once accompanies the messengers to Sultan Mengindra's court.
He makes his entry into the strange capital with becoming splendor,
and is received with great honor. The queen now makes herself
known to her father, who is moved to tears. Banquets and great
tournaments follow, and happiness pervades the court. The king
returns after a time to his own land, but continues as long as he lives
to send gifts and goods to his daughter and her royal lord.</p>

<h2>THE COLORS OF FLOWERS.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By HENRI COUPIN.</span></p>


<p>Much might be said, from an artistic and poetic point of view,
concerning the colors of flowers. It is in the corolla that
they reveal themselves in their most minute delicacy. The tints
so widely diffused among animals, even those of butterflies, are
coarse as compared with them, and the painter's palette is powerless
to reproduce them. They run through the whole gamut of the
solar spectrum, even to its most minute details. Some naturalists
have striven to establish a classification of them, and it will be convenient
to be acquainted with their efforts, though they are not
decisive and are somewhat artificial, like all classifications. We
give one of the most ingenious of them:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="colours within the cyanic/ xanthic series">
<tr><td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td><td colspan="2"><span class="smcap">Green.</span></td></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="5">Cyanic series.</td><td rowspan="5"><span style="font-size:700%;font-weight:lighter;margin:0;line-height:1em;text-indent:0;"> { </span></td><td align="left" class="bor_right">Greenish-blue.</td><td align="left">Yellow-green.</td><td rowspan="5"><span style="font-size:700%;font-weight:lighter;margin:0;line-height:1em;text-indent:0;"> } </span></td><td rowspan="5">Xanthic series.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" class="bor_right">Blue.</td><td align="left">Yellow.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" class="bor_right">Blue-violet.</td><td align="left">Yellow-orange.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" class="bor_right">Violet.</td><td align="left">Orange.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" class="bor_right">Violet-red.</td><td align="left">Orange-red.</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td><td colspan="2"><span class="smcap">Red.</span></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The type of the cyanic series is blue, and that of the xanthic
series yellow. The first is sometimes denominated the deoxidized
series, and the second the oxidized, but these designations have
hardly solid enough foundations to be preserved. De Candolle, who
publishes the table in his Vegetable Physiology, appends some interesting
remarks to it.</p>

<p>It will be noticed by the inspection of the table that nearly all
the flowers susceptible of changes of color, as a rule, simply go up
or down the scale of shades of the series to which they belong.
Thus, in the xanthic series the flowers of the <i>Nyctago jalapa</i> may be
yellow, yellow-orange, or red; those of <i>Rosa eglantina</i> yellow-orange
or orange-red; those of nasturtium from yellow to orange;
the flowers of <i>Ranunculus asiaticus</i> present all the colors of red
up to green; those of the <i>Hieracium staticefolium</i>, and of some
other yellow <i>Chicorace&aelig;</i> and of some <i>Leguminos&aelig;</i> like the lotus,
become greenish-yellow when dried, etc. In the cyanic series the
flowers of many <i>Boraginace&aelig;</i>, especially of <i>Lithospermum purpureo-c&aelig;ruleum</i>,
vary from blue to violet-red; those of hortensia
from rose to blue; the ligulate flowers of the asters from blue to
red or violet; those of the hyacinths from blue to red, etc.</p>

<p>There are, however, a few apparent exceptions to this rule.
Thus, although the hyacinths usually vary only in the blues, reds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
or white, yellowish varieties, indicating an approach to the xanthic
series, are sometimes found in gardens. The auricula, which is
originally yellow, passes to reddish-brown, to green, and to a sort
of violet, but never reaches pure blue; and single petals occasionally
give suggestions of both series in distinct parts of their surfaces.</p>

<p>Some surprise may be felt that white does not figure in De Candolle's
table. This is because an absolutely white color does not
seem to exist in any flower. The fact may be shown by placing some
flowers supposed to be of the purest white, like the lily, the white
campanula, or the wood anemone, on a leaf of clear white paper.
It will be found that the white of the corolla is really washed with
yellow, blue, or orange, according to what flower is taken. If the
tint does not appear distinct, infusions of the corollas in alcohol
will present tones unmistakably yellow or red, etc. White flowers
are therefore flowers with tints appertaining to one of De Candolle's
series, but albinized, as if they were etiolated. A small
number of flowers begin white, and are subsequently colored under
the action of light. The <i>Cheiranthus chameleo</i> passes from white
to citron-yellow and a slightly violet-red; the <i>&AElig;nothera tetraptera</i>,
at first white, becomes rose and then almost red; the petals of the
Indian tamarind are white the first day and yellow the second;
and the corolla of the <i>Cobea scandens</i> comes out greenish-white
and turns to violet the second day. The most remarkable plant
in this respect is <i>Hibiscus mutabilis</i>, which Rumph calls the hourly
flower, because it starts white, turns flesh-color toward noon, and
becomes red at sunset.</p>

<p>In his recent work on Plants and their Cosmic Media, M. Costantin
has some remarks concerning the precocity of various races
and the tint of their flowers. Hoffmann made observations on
this point for several years. He remarked, as the result of eight
years' observation, that the common lilac with white flowers blooms
on an average six days earlier than the normal form with purple
flowers. This might be a curious anomaly with no bearing, but
the more we advance in the study of Nature the more we perceive
that all phenomena, even the most insignificant, deserve to be examined.
Similar results have been observed in varieties of radish
(<i>Raphanus raphanistrum</i>) and of saffron (<i>Crocus vernus</i>); in the
former the white flowers expand on an average of sixteen days
earlier than the yellow ones (twelve years of observation), and in
the latter plant the difference is four days.</p>

<p>These changes of tint sometimes appear to depend on the temperature.
Thus, the white lilac was obtained by horticulturists
under the influence of a temperature of between 30&deg; and 35&deg; C.
We can not, however, affirm that spontaneous races with white flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
originated in the same way as the white lilac. It will be enough
to point out a few facts that may contribute to the guidance of persons
who are seeking to learn the origin of these colored varieties.
The <i>Papava alpinum</i> has a very stable variety with yellow flowers,
which, according to Focke, has been observed in the polar regions,
while the white varieties have been seen in Switzerland. The cultivation
of the same species at Giessen, Germany, has made it possible
to obtain specimens with white flowers by metamorphosis from
specimens with yellow flowers, but it is impossible to say whether
or not heat is the agent that produces the changes in these cases.
The experiments of MM. Sch&uuml;bela and Bonnier have shown that
flowers become darker without changing their color in high regions
and in those near the pole; but this phenomenon is one of
light and not of color. Be their origin what it may, these white
and colored forms have remarkable fixedness.</p>

<p>It will be observed that black does not figure in the table of
the classification of colors given above. Absolute black, in fact,
does not exist in any flower. If some parts appear black, it is only
because their tint is excessively dark. The black of the petals of
<i>Pelargonium triste</i> and of the bean is yellow, and that of the <i>Orchis
nigra</i> is a brown. Apparent blacks are, moreover, extremely rare.</p>

<p>The gamut of the reds is much more varied than that of other
colors. The reds of the xanthic series are generally more lively-hued,
carnation or flame-colored; those of the cyanic series present
tints more nearly approaching violet. These two reds may
furthermore give rose-colors, but a little skill will divine their origin.
The rose of the hydrangea inclines to blue, while that of the
rose tends rather toward yellow. Blue colors are the most variable,
and readily pass to violet and red, but most frequently to
white. The most tenacious hues are those of yellow, and we might
affirm that the bright and glistening yellow of the buttercup may be
said never to change. The paler yellows change more easily, but
rarely pass to anything but white. Green flowers, not being readily
distinguished from the foliage around them, need not be specially
mentioned. They are believed to be much rarer than they
really are.</p>

<p>Horticulturists are able, by cultivation, selection, and hybridization,
to cause the colors of flowers to vary in considerable proportions.
Not much is known of the laws of these variations,
chiefly because gardeners who might tell botanists of them if they
would have not the scientific spirit. We cite here what MM. Decaisne
and Naudin<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> say respecting the variations of the color of
flowers:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span></p>
<p>"Change in this respect is effected in two ways: sometimes there
is a simple discoloration, drawing the red, yellow, or blue tints
of the corolla toward a more or less pure white; sometimes there
is a radical substitution of one color for another. Flowers in
which red or blue are the dominant tints are most subject to turn
white, but the change may also be observed on some flowers that
are naturally yellow, such as the disk of the daisy, the dahlia, and
the chrysanthemum when those flowers suffer ligular transformation.
Nothing, on the other hand, is more common in our gardens
than white varieties of pink or of red roses, lilac, scarlet runners,
larkspur, purple digitalis, Canterbury bells, etc.&mdash;in fact, nearly
all plants with lilac, rose, red, purple, blue, or violet flowers. There
are some flowers, however, in these categories the coloration of
which is very persistent, and rarely fades perceptibly&mdash;as may be
seen in the purple petunias, the hue of which does not lose its
vivacity even when it is crossed with the white variety.</p>

<p>"The radical substitution of one color for another, whether
over the whole corolla or only on some of its parts, in the form of
spots, stripes, or variegations, is also of frequent occurrence, and
is one of the sorts of modifications which horticulturists have used
with great advantage. A considerable number of 'fancy' plants
derive almost all their importance from the facility with which
the liveliest colors replace one another, blend, and intermix in a
thousand ways and in relative proportions of which nothing is fixed,
so that we can not find in these collections, when they are well
chosen, two plants out of a hundred that are exactly alike in the
tone and distribution of their colors. These multicolored varieties,
all the offspring of cultivation, are generally perpetuated true
by cuttings, while the seedlings compensate for the uncertainty
of what they will produce by the certainty that they will give rise
to new combinations of colors. This is not the case with single-colored
varieties, which, unless they are crossed with others, tend
to perpetuate themselves through their seedlings. The yellow,
white, and purple varieties of the four-o'clock, for example, when
they are pure, reproduce themselves constantly; when crossed with
one another they give rise to intermediately colored flowers, and
more frequently to variegated ones."</p>

<p>Mr. Hughes Gibb observed, in the mild winter of 1897-'98,
that flowers blooming out of season were liable not to have the
same color as regularly blooming ones.</p>

<p>The cactus dahlia, usually red, has put out flowers almost orange
and with exterior florets sometimes nearly yellow. On the other
hand, these dahlias have often shown a marked tendency to return
to the simpler form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p>

<p>A species of nasturtium, habitually of a bright scarlet-red, has
given in the cold frame late flowers of a bright yellow, a red band
near the center of the petals remaining the only vestige of the normal
color. In both cases the change of color began on the edges
of the petals. The flower of the myosotis, normally bright blue, has
become almost clear rose, without the slightest trace of blue; and
a pure blue phlox has shown a tendency toward greenish-yellow.&mdash;<i>Translated

<h2>FOLKLORE OF THE ALLEGHANIES.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By FRANCES ALBERT DOUGHTY.</span></p>


<p>The West Virginia mountaineer lives very close to Nature, and
viewed from many standpoints the relation is characterized by
pleasing amenities: juicy berries refresh him along the road; nuts
drop into his path; "sang" (ginseng), which makes one of his sources
of revenue, reveals itself to his eye as he follows the cows to pasture;
a cool brook springs up to quench his thirst when weary of following
the plow; pine knots are always within reach to make light as
well as warmth; mud and stones easily combine in his hand to
shape a daub chimney; and a trough dug out of an old tree furnishes
a receptacle that is as good for dough at one end as for a baby at
the other.</p>

<p>Often, however, this close relation to Nature assumes a war
attitude, fierce and uncompromising. If hungry wolves no longer
howl furiously at the back fence after nightfall, or gnaw at the log
pens which secure the stock, and if panthers are seldom bold enough
to spring at a horse's flanks as a man rides along in the daytime,
bears are still numerous enough to devour a large number of sheep
every year in spite of precautions, and they have a pronounced taste
for sweet young corn. The living wrested from the soil in the short
and changeable summer months must cover the winter's need as
well; it is generally so scant and uncertain that the mountaineer
feels a chronic discouragement toward agriculture as a pursuit and
resource. He must depend on it, and yet as far back as he or his
father can remember there has always been some reason why "a
good crop" could not be made that year. The West Virginian lives in
a large and thinly settled game preserve, but the fleet deer usually
contrives to escape the hunter's chill wait in the autumnal dawn, the
coy wild turkey is overshy of his lure, and the wary trout requires
a very patient rod. In the long winter deep snows cover the fences,
groups or "bunches" of cows and sheep often perish in the drifts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
and the human prisoners in their cabins, huddling around the wood
fires, are nearly always, as they express it, "short of" some article
which would be considered a necessity in the average city home.</p>

<p>The varying, defiant, and incalculable moods and phases of Nature
bring so many chances into the humble lot of the mountaineer that
it is not surprising he should interpret her phenomena as having a
distinctly personal import. Anciently, around Olympus the talk was
of "omens," "auguries," and "fate"; dwellers along the chain of
the Alleghanies to-day talk of "signs," "spells," and "luck," and
these words held their significance for hundreds of years in the ancestral
stock of the first settlers in the region, most of the folklore
being directly traceable to a Scotch-Irish strain of blood. The mountain
pattern taken far from cities probably differs little either mentally
or physically from that of the colonial mountaineers. Even
with the railroad traversing a limited area, and the influx of summer
visitors during three months of the year, the only perceptible change
wrought in the natives is a little sharpening of their wits from the
barter of fruit and furs at the hotels in the extensive mineral-spring
section. The Alleghany mountaineer, ignorant, narrow-minded,
honest, brave, and hospitable, remains what he was when the eagle
soared from the inaccessible eyrie above his head to be chosen
as the tutelary genius of the unconquerable young republic.
The chief distinction in the temperament of the sexes is that the
men are frank and talkative, the women shy and uncommunicative.
Beings approaching the legendary fauns and satyrs, clad in
the skins of wild animals, are sometimes discovered by the solitary
horseman in the wild mountain fastnesses; they gaze at him as an
apparition from a strange world, never having seen a village or heard
a railroad whistle.</p>

<p>There is a curious and persistent survival of the belief in witchcraft
through this mineral-spring belt in West Virginia. To draw
out the natives on this mysterious subject they must be approached
sympathetically; if twitted with their credulity they will shut up
like clams, for with all the simplicity of the unlettered their intuition
often arrives at a correct understanding of the estimate placed
upon them by more fortunate persons. When satisfied that he is
not expected to pose as a "freak," but is met on the equal plane of
human intercourse, the mountain story-teller seems to enjoy recounting
the traditions and beliefs of his people and their forefathers.
Leaving himself a loophole of escape, he is very likely to finish his
yarn with&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Tain't that I believe them things myself. I know they ain't
nawthin' but superstition; but I kin qualify that right round here,
not many miles away, there's people that believes in witches."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>

<p>In a little cottage on a much-traveled thoroughfare one woman
admitted to me with bated breath, as though not quite sure her tormentor
was dead, that she had been bewitched. Her account was
given in these words:</p>

<p>"I kep' seein' an old woman with a cow's hoof in her hand;
sometimes she was by my side an' sometimes she was there on the
wall. At last she come up close to me, an' she was goin' to clap
the cow's hoof over my mouth, but I slapped at her right hard an'
she went away. She ain't never come again. Yes, I <i>know</i> I was
bewitched."</p>

<p>A cow's hoof is a frequent accessory, and animals that are brought
into the magic circle are always of a domestic character, completely
subservient to the power of the witch.</p>

<p>It is noticeable that the exercise of witchcraft is generally
ascribed to women; and that of witch mastery, the superior attribute,
to men.</p>

<p>The form of a judicial process found favor with the Puritan temperament
in old Salem, although by a grim mockery the verdict was
decided in advance. The independent mountaineer likes to take the
law in his own hands, as the following story illustrates:</p>

<p>"A farmer believed a woman was bewitching his stock. He
drew a picture of her and set it up as a target; then he sunk a piece
of silver in his bullet with an awl, <i>that being the charm for shooting
a witch</i>. He aimed to shoot the picture through the heart,
but fired a little too low. On that very day the woman herself
fell flat on the ground, and a deep, awful hole was found in her
side. From that minute she suffered extreme agony, and died in
a week."</p>

<p>The narrator had heard this grewsome tale from his grandmother,
who said that she had seen the hole.</p>

<p>One of the oldest inhabitants of Monroe County is responsible
for the ensuing chronicle; he dates it in the "forties" of the present
century:</p>

<p>"'Tain't so very long ago there was a woman livin' near the
Sweet Springs who used to be always seen with a cap and bonnet
on; nobody ever saw her without the cap. She was a hard, grim-lookin'
monster. If anybody was watchin' to see her ontie her cap
strings, somehow they never could see any more until the clean cap
was on&mdash;now that's <i>so</i>, there ain't any mistake about that! When
she come over here from Botetourt County the report followed her
that she lived pretty close to a man whose chillun went to school, an'
a calf had been in the habit of attackin' 'em an' bitin' em. The
father concealed himself one day and was watchin' to catch the
calf. On that occasion it come out an' attacked the chillun on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
bridge across a little stream o' water. He ran and caught the calf
and cut off his ears with a knife. They always believed that <i>the
old witch had turned herself into that calf</i>, and so when she turned
back into a woman she wore the cap to hide that she didn't have any
ears. There was three sisters of 'em; it was reported they was all
witches, possessed of some uncommon art. John and Harriet had
two little pet pullets they thought a good deal of. The cap-woman
wanted 'em; they just fluttered an' fluttered till they died. Her
name was Nancy L&mdash;&mdash;. Well, she wanted the carpenter to make
her a piece of furniture out of an old dirty plank she had, an' he
wouldn't do it. He said it was gritty and it would ruin his tools.
Then she got mad and said, 'I'll make you suffer in the flesh for
that!' One day soon after that he was at his hog pen feedin' the
hogs, when suddenly he was struck down perfectly helpless, so he
couldn't speak. He thought it was paralytic or rheumatism. In
those days there was an old doctor in Staunton, Augusta County,
who had a kind o' process to steam people and boil 'em in a big
kettle, for rheumatism. He put sump'n fireproof, a paste or ointment,
all over 'em, like the fireproof you put on buildings, an' boiled
'em an hour or two hours, as the case might be. The carpenter went
to consult him, an' he put him in a kettle that was big enough for
him either to stand or sit down in it; a collar was fitted tight round
his neck so the hot water couldn't get into his face and eyes. The
boilin' didn't seem to do him any good. When he got home he
halted about for twelve months or more. First he felt a pain in his
hip, and then he felt a pain by the side of his knee as if it was gradually
workin' down; then one day there was sump'n jaggin' in the
calf of his leg. He put his leg up on a bench and an old gentleman
seen sump'n stickin' out. He took a pair of nippers an' ketched
holt an' pulled out a big shirtin' needle. Hugh kept the needle as
long as he lived, and he believed Nancy the old witch shot him with
it. He halted on that leg the balance of his days. <i>I've seen the
needle</i>; it's God's truth!"</p>

<p>A spice of profanity seems to have the virtue of embalming a
witch story in the mountain memory. A rustic maiden who lives
with her family on one of the loneliest hilltops in the Alleghanies,
only to be reached on foot or horseback, makes this contribution to
the folklore of the region:</p>

<p>"An old lady not far off had three daughters, and she was going
to learn 'em to be witches. They had to sit on the hearth by the
fire and take off their shoes and grease their heels so as to go up
the chimney, and they were not allowed to speak. The mother was
to go first and the girls were to follow. The old lady and the two
foremost ones had all got up safe, but the last girl, when she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
in a narrow place in the chimney, said, 'This is a d&mdash;d tight
squeeze!' With that she fell back and was burned up."</p>

<p>The value of silence and self-control appears to be the only touch
of morality in the witch logic. Manifestations of the black art
frequently take place by or over running water. These characteristics
are observed in another story from the same maid of the
mountain:</p>

<p>"Two witches were going to rob a store in the night, and they
took a young man with them as a partner. They put the greased
witch cap on his head so he could go through the keyhole. They all
started out, and presently they came to a river. They saw some
calves in a field, and caught three of 'em; they mounted the two that
were heifers and the boy got on the steer calf. They charged him of
all things not to speak on the journey. The witches jumped the river
on their calves without makin' a sound, but just as he was jumping
across he cried out, 'That was a d&mdash;d good jump for a steer calf!'
Well, they all went on, and when they got to the store they passed
through the keyhole one after another, the young man too. They
took all the money they wanted, but when the time came to leave he
couldn't get out of the keyhole, because he had spoken, and the
spell was broken. He was found in the store the next morning,
and had to take all the punishment."</p>

<p>It is interesting to note as an offset to all these diabolic attributes
and potencies that a firm faith exists in a beneficent Power back of
them which under given conditions will prevail over evil. "God is
always stronger than the devil" is the mountain way of expressing
this dependence, and there are charlatans who take advantage of it
by going about as "witch masters." One of these died a few years
ago, and another farther back, an Irishman named "Mosey," is
quoted yet for his successes as "master of all the witches and all the
devils."</p>

<p>When the cows had been eating mushrooms and their milk became
too bitter to make good butter, Mosey was sent for at once to
"cure the witchcraft" and "take off the spell." He took his regular
beat through his part of the mountain country once in a while.
An old man who oscillates between the "White" and the "Sweet,"
selling canes, remembers him well. He tells of one woman's experience
who "filed a complaint" that her cow wouldn't give much milk,
and that the milk wouldn't "gether" for butter.</p>

<p>"'Woman,' says Mosey, 'your cow's bewitched, and badly bewitched!'</p>

<p>"'Can you do anything for her, Mosey, and what will you
charge?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, I can cure her if you'll pay me five dollars and give me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
five pounds of butter to take home with me to burn in the fire to
cap the climax and burn out the spell.'</p>

<p>"Then he want through his enchantments over the cow, and
took the money and the butter home with him. One day when he
had been drinking a little I asked him if he really burned all that
butter. 'Divil a grain of it did I burn; I ate it with my pertaties.'
It was on that same trip when Mosey was curin' the cow that a
man who lived near by sent for him. 'I feel mighty quare, Mosey,'
says he, 'an' I can't describe exactly how I do feel!' 'You're
bewitched, sir,' says he, 'and badly bewitched!' (he always used
those words). 'Faith, an' I'll try and cure ye! Have ye got any
blue yarn about the house?' The man's wife went to look for some,
and she came back with a hank of blue yarn. Mosey wound off
enough of it to make a cord about the size of his finger; they twisted
it together, he pretending to put some enchantments on it, and then
he told the sick man to fasten it round his waist next to his skin.
'Don't you lose it on peril of your life,' says he, 'or you're a dead
man!' 'Peggy, get a needle and sew it on me!' he says to his wife,
an' she done it. He gradually got well&mdash;may be he'd a got well anyway.
I can't vouch for that."</p>

<p>When asked if such things were still happening, the cane-seller
replied:</p>

<p>"Not three weeks ago a woman thought her cow was bewitched
because her butter wouldn't gather, and she het an old horseshoe hot
and dropped it in the churn of milk. When she churned again the
butter on that occasion gathered, and <i>it was the same milk</i> that was
in the churn to burn the witch. You can put that down for
June, '93."</p>

<p>The Potts Creek neighborhood is said to be a center for the witch
superstition. It is also a favorite place for "bush meetings," to
which the natives come from a distance in their wagons with picnic
dinners of salt-risen corn pone and sliced bacon, and there they
listen approvingly to fervid exhortations that are based on orthodox
Baptist and Methodist doctrines. The West Virginia mountaineer
is profoundly religious in temperament, and considers that he has
scriptural ground for a belief in witchcraft.</p>

<h2>ORIGIN OF ANCIENT HINDU ASTRONOMY.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By the Count GOBLET D'ALVIELLA.</span></p>


<p>It is manifest that India is indebted for some of its astronomy to
the Greeks. Not that it had not astronomy and astronomers
from an epoch anterior to the invasion of Alexander. It had, in
fact, been necessary to make observations of the heavens in order to
fix a calendar that would enable the sacrifices of the Vedic ritual in
connection with the return of the seasons and the revolutions of the
stars to be celebrated at the right dates. Further, the belief in astrology,
or the influence exercised by the movements of the planets
on physical phenomena and all the events of human life, would lead,
in India as elsewhere, to the observation and anticipation of everything
relating to the conjunction and opposition of the heavenly
bodies.</p>

<p>The Rig-Veda has allusions to the phases and stations of the
moon. The stations (<i>nakshatras</i>) consisted, according to a tradition
preserved by the Brahmans, of twenty-seven constellations (afterward
twenty-eight) which the moon was supposed to traverse successively
in the course of its sidereal revolution. A lunar zodiac
and a primary division of time into months were thus obtained. The
moon, moreover, bears in the Veda the name of month-maker (<i>m&acirc;sakrit</i>).
Each station was assigned a uniform length of 13&deg; 20' on
the ecliptic, and a denomination, generally derived from mythology.
The month, in turn, took its name from the constellation that had
the honor of harboring the moon. Manon and the Djyotisha (a
special treatise included among the V&eacute;d&acirc;ngas, or commentaries on
the Vedas) tell us that the year was composed of twelve months,
the month of thirty days, the day of thirty hours, the hour of
forty-eight minutes, all strictly sexagesimal subdivisions, like our
own measures of time. The Djyotisha also teaches the art of constructing
a clepsydra, or water-clock.</p>

<p>The adjustment of the solar year to correspond with the lunar
year and of the two with the civil year dates from this period. The
month was still composed of thirty days, but the solar years were
grouped into quinquennial periods, in the middle and at the end of
which the lunar month was doubled. Combining these quinquennial
periods with the revolutions of the planet <i>Brihaspati</i> (Jupiter),
which was calculated as occupying about twelve years, the Indian
astronomers computed an astronomical cycle of sixty solar years.
As the same cycle is found with the Chaldeans, where, according to
Berosus, it was called the <i>Sossos</i>, we have to inquire how far Brahmanic
astronomy was influenced by the systems which were originally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
formed in ancient Chaldea. The presumption of such an influence
furnishes a simpler and more probable hypothesis than the
effort to trace the earliest astronomical ideas of the Hindus, as
M. W. Brennand has recently suggested, to a period when the ancestors
of the Aryans, the Semites, and the Chinese were wandering
together over the plateaus of central Asia!</p>

<p>We know now, from the cuneiform inscriptions, that the Chaldeans
had, at a period far anterior to the entrance of the Aryans
into India, invented a double calendar, solar and lunar, with intercalary
periods; discovered the proper motion of the planets; calculated
the return of eclipses; and constituted a double metrical
system, decimal and sexagesimal; and, as was done, too, in India,
had divided the circumference into three hundred and sixty degrees
of sixty minutes each. It is impossible to draw the lines
exactly between the astronomical discoveries which the Hindus borrowed
from abroad and those which they drew from their own resources
prior to the invasion of the Greeks, but we need in no case
go farther than Mesopotamia for the source of the borrowed data.</p>

<p>The ancient literature of India contains observations of the positions
or conjunctions of some of the stars that carry us back to
positive dates in the history of the sky. The astronomers Bailly,
Colebrooke, and Bentley, and, more recently, M. Brennand, have
found notes relative to astronomical phenomena that took place
in the twelfth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and even the twenty-first centuries
<span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> Max M&uuml;ller, however, advises prudence and reserve in
accepting these calculations, some of which may have been afterthoughts,
and others offer only apparent agreements.</p>

<p>In any case, the advent of Buddhism, by depreciating the religious
practices and astrological speculations of the Brahmans, contributed
to bringing on a decline of astronomy at the very time
it was taking its most vigorous stand among the Greeks. We learn
from a passage in Strabo that the Pramnai regarded the Brahmans
as boasters and mad because they were interested in physiology
and astronomy. Now, there really exists an ancient Buddhist
treatise in which the predictions by the Brahmans of eclipses of the
sun and of the conjunctions and oppositions of the planets, and their
discussions of the appearance of comets and meteors, are treated as
despicable arts and lies.</p>

<p>It was just at this age that Hellenic culture was developed in
northwest India. It held astronomy, and astrology too, in great
esteem. The Milinda Panda mentions the royal astrologer as one
of the principal functionaries of Menander. No doubt there were,
among the Gavanas (Ionians) of Taxila and Euthyd&ecirc;mia, minds
versed in the knowledge of the principal cosmological systems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
formulated among the Greeks from Thales to Aristotle, and also acquainted
with all the progress in the physical and mathematical
sciences that had been achieved by the Alexandrian astronomers in
the last centuries before Christ. To comprehend the extent of the
influence of Hellenic science, we have only to inquire what Hindu
astronomy had become again at the time of the restoration of the
Brahmans in the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> Aryabhatta teaches the rotation
of the earth around its axis; maintains that the moon, naturally
dark, owes its light to the rays of the sun; formulates the true theory
of eclipses; assigns an elliptical form to the planetary epicycles; and
demonstrates the displacement of the equinoctial and solstitial
points. Var&acirc;ha-Mihira devotes himself especially to astrological
labors, but also has the merit of having condensed into a vast encyclop&aelig;dia
the <i>Pantcha Siddh&acirc;ntik&acirc;</i>, the principal astronomical treatises
that were current in India. And Brahmazoupta is especially
famous for his revision of an older treatise, the <i>Brahma Siddh&acirc;nta</i>.</p>

<p>In the opinion of the most competent critics, these works, which
are chiefly empirical methods of determining the positions of the
stars, are inferior to those which the Alexandrians have left us.
Yet, in matters relating to the measurement of arcs and to spherical
trigonometry, they reveal a more advanced state of the science. It
is impossible to determine at what period this new astronomical science
was constituted in India. Some of its theories squarely betray
their indebtedness to Greek science, as, for instance, that of the displacement
of the equinoctial and solstitial points by a periodical
vibration or tremor. We can also say as much of the solar zodiac,
the names of the constellations of which strikingly resemble the
Greek names in form as well as in significance, and the same of the
names of the chief planets. Other expressions are found, notably
in the works of Var&acirc;ha-Mihira, which indicate, if not a borrowing,
a contact, at least, with the works of the Greek astronomy, of which
Mr. Burgess gives a fairly complete list in his Notes on Hindu Astronomy
and the History of our Knowledge of it, in the Journal of
the Royal Asiatic Society. Among these terms, some are Greek
words which have been utilized in naming constellations or astronomical
measures; others have retained the special significations
which they had in the works of the Alexandrian astronomers. It
would certainly be an exaggeration to insist that the adoption of a
foreign term of necessity implies the borrowing of the idea which
it expresses. It is, nevertheless, probable that the Sanskrit writers
would not have made use of so many of these exotic denominations
if the ideas they represent had already found their expression in
the languages of India.</p>

<p>Further, among the fine Sidd&acirc;ntas which Var&acirc;ha-Mihira<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
collected and condensed as including all the astronomical science of
his time, there are two, the <i>Romaka</i> and the <i>Pauli&ccedil;a</i>, the names
of which suggest directly&mdash;the first the scientific culture of the
Roman world, and the other Paulus, a celebrated Alexandrian astronomer
of the third century <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>We apparently find, likewise, the names of Manetho (fourth century
<span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span>) in <i>Manittha</i> or <i>Manimda</i>; of Spensippus in <i>Sporedjivadja</i>;
and of Ptolemy in <i>Asoura Maya</i>, whom the <i>Sounya Siddh&acirc;nta</i>
designates as the founder of astronomy, and who another
treatise says was born at Romakapouri, "the city of the Romans."</p>

<p>In this order of ideas the natives of India have never tried to
deny their sources. The Gavanas, we read in the <i>Garg&iacute; Samhit&acirc;</i>,
are barbarians; but this science (astrology) has been constituted
by them, and they must be revered as saints. M. Weber affirms
that a treatise on astrology bearing their name, the <i>Gavana &Ccedil;astra</i>,
was reputed to have been written in the land of the Gavanas by the
god Sourya in person, when, expelled from heaven by the resentment
of his divine rivals, he came down and was born again in the
city of the Romans.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>We find, further, that the Greek calendar appears to have survived
Hellenic domination in northern India. General Cunningham,
in 1862, read in the inscriptions of the Indo-Scythians the
names of the Macedonian months Artemisios and Appellaios. Since
then the names of two other months of that calendar&mdash;Panemos and
Daisios&mdash;have been found in inscriptions in the Kharosthis character.</p>

<p>Another era of Grecian origin, that of the Seleucid&aelig;, seems
likewise to have furnished the Hindus their first historical computation.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
It should be observed, in fact, that their most ancient era,
that of the Mauryas, dates from the year 312 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span>, or the beginning
of the era of the Seleucid&aelig;. This had been adopted by the Grecian
sovereigns of India, as is attested by a coin of Plato, struck in the
year 166 <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span></p>

<p>Beginning with the Indo-Scythians, India generally adopted the
era of the Cakas, which began, not, as had been long supposed, with
the expulsion of the Scythians, but with the coronation of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
principal sovereign, Kanichka.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Nevertheless, the inscriptions offer
still other historical computations, as, for instance, that of the Gouptas
era, which began in the year 240 of the &Ccedil;aka era, and that of
Vikram&acirc;ditya, which was made to begin retrospectively fifty-six
years <span class="smcap lowercase">B. C.</span> Hence arise complications of a nature to make the task
of paleography and history no lighter.&mdash;<i>Translated for the Popular

<h2>SKETCH OF WILLIAM KEITH BROOKS.</h2>


<p>The old problem of Nature <i>versus</i> nurture that meets us in
studying the life history of any organism becomes especially
interesting in dealing with the biography of men of eminence. Are
their achievements the inevitable expression of the natural forces
innate in them at birth, or the product of environmental influences,
or some resultant of these two factors? And how much may we in
each case assign to one factor or to the other?</p>

<p>These difficult questions naturally suggest themselves in glancing
at the life of the subject of this sketch. Like so many men who
have won prominence in comparatively new countries, he seemed, in
an environment that had no apparent relation to his future, to grow
from innate tendencies toward something not suggested by the circumstances
about him, even to grow in opposition to the molding
influences of these, and to conquer them. Later, however, we find
him surrounded by influences that made a particular mode of self-expression
easy, if they may not be said to have forced such expression.
It was then that the casual observer might say that the circumstances
made the man; yet, looking backward, we can trace the
initiative in the man that led him into the congenial environment.
A selection of proper environment to express Nature has been
rightly claimed as a potent factor in all organic life; nurture, then,
comes as a secondary power to mold, or rather to translate, the
inherent power.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Keith Brooks</span>, the second son of Oliver Allen Brooks
and Eleanora Bradbury, daughter of the Rev. Phineas Kingsley,
was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1848. In 1877 he married Amelia
Katherine, daughter of Edward T. Schultz and Susan Rebecca,
daughter of David L. Martin. He has two children.</p>

<p>Brooks grew up amid the stimulating influences of a relatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
new country, where freedom of development was not so sharply
restricted but that all paths of life seemed equally open to one who
would work. As a boy he was not one of those precocious naturalists
of the common sort whose collecting instincts find expression
in the hoarding of dead animals or plants rather than the neater
postage stamp; names and authorities, classes and species, neatly
arranged mummies, were not his delight. At first there seemed
no sign that zo&ouml;logy would claim him as a most ardent admirer.
Yet he was fond of live things and their ways, and introduced into
his home that most delightful microcosm, the fresh-water aquarium
(so much neglected in this country), in which he could observe at
ease the habits and slow changes of living things when their native
haunts were not accessible. Such early interest in the essential
wonders of livingness rather than in man's artificial classification
of phenomena was thus prophetic of much of his later originality
of thought and view.</p>

<p>He has never forgotten how much he owes to the instruction of
the earnest and broad-minded teachers in the public schools of Cleveland.</p>

<p>His college life began at Hobart, where two years left a deep
impression from an acquaintance with Berkeley's thought, gained
in browsing in the library, and long treasured up to produce fruit
in philosophic views of maturer years. Then at Williams College,
where the notable Natural History Society was sending out its expedition
across South America, his love of Nature matured and specialized
for two years longer, until he received the A. B. degree in
1870. It was Williams also that later, in 1893, bestowed upon him
the LL. D. degree. For him the completion of college life was
truly the "commencement" and not the finish of his intellectual
training. His strong trend toward pure science and abstract mental
life forced him onward into post-graduate work. But this required
funds, and America was not Germany; the struggle for existence
was not here so intense that one might not win bread in
many walks of life without special training, and parents did not
need to extend the larval period of support for offspring beyond
the completion of college life to gain for them a place in any rank,
social or intellectual. Now, a rapidly increasing need for the Ph. D.
degree as entrance to professional life, necessitating several years
of post-graduate study, often forces parents to take up their share
in the increased burden. Then, however, few were agreed as to
the advisability of prolonging an unpractical life devoted to study
beyond what seemed the maximum limit of unproductive preparation
for life&mdash;the day of graduation at college. Beyond that the
young man must make his own way as best he might. The subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
of this sketch chose to work his way by his own unaided efforts into
the fullest measure of academic training.</p>

<p>That was before the day of competition between universities,
and there was no temptation to go here rather than there in order
to live a semi-parasitic existence as scholar or fellowship holder.</p>

<p>First in his father's counting house, and then at a boy's school
near Niagara, young Brooks bravely gained the means to pursue
higher branches of natural history, and to devote himself to research.
In the former position he realized how futile for him
would be a life given to money-getting, and he palliated the uncongenial
nature of that life by such abstract thought as seemed useful,
one immediate result of which was the invention of a mechanical
device for computing interest and discounts in sterling money,
that had considerable circulation. This, though it scarcely indicated
a stronger bias for mathematics than for Nature study, showed
a latent possibility that was not to be developed. In the latter
position, which brought him in close contact with the wonders
of time action, so plainly read in one of Nature's books for the
blind&mdash;Niagara Falls&mdash;he found food for thought, as well as a deep
interest in the action of young minds. Here was much material
for philosophical study of wood life too, as well as for growth of
conceptions of the way to learn and to teach.</p>

<p>Free, after serving three years, to follow his genius, Agassiz's
romantic venture at Pennikese drew this young naturalist, as it did
so many of that epoch; and henceforth marine life, with its revelation
of fundamental problems, fascinated him. Working on at
Agassiz's museum, learning its collections by heart, absorbing from
this center of American natural history and from its founder both
stimulus and method, influenced deeply also by the unobtrusive
teachings of McCrady and others who helped to make Cambridge
the Mecca of naturalists, he was already an active contributor to
the discussion of problems in the embryology of animals when he
won his Ph. D. degree in 1875.</p>

<p>Quiet, diffident, slow to speak, leaving hasty action, too, for
those of other constitution, with thoughtful brow and keen eye to
look outward, as well as to regard inner thought, this young man
with flowing beard was a noticeable person. At this time he was
to be seen always accompanied by his faithful "Tige"; for, wiser
than Ulysses, he shared all the hardships and joys of life with this
loved companion.</p>

<p>Now he sought his true environment, and found it in the new
university starting in 1876&mdash;the Johns Hopkins University. There
he was appointed Fellow, an honor subsequently won by many who
are well known to biological science, as W. T. Sedgwick, E. B.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
Wilson, K. Mitsukuri, A. F. W. Schimper, H. H. Donaldson, H. L.
Osborn, J. McKeen Cattell, H. H. Howell, A. T. Bruce, E. S. Lee,
H. E. Nachtrieb, W. Noyes, J. Jastrow, E. B. Mall, H. V. Wilson,
C. E. Hodge, S. Watase, and T. H. Morgan. Like C. O. Whitman,
in 1879, he did not enter upon the privileges of that position, but as
instructor and associate became at once a guiding element in the
new growth. In the freedom from old traditions, from fixed conventions
and routines offered by this new university, this peculiar
original mind found its best environment, and while the opportunity
doubtless did much for the man, the man certainly reacted most
favorably for the welfare of the highest ideals of his new home.</p>

<p>We find him at once outspoken in emphasis of the philosophical
aspect of animal morphology, contributing thoughts upon "inductive
reasoning in morphological problems," upon "the relation between
embryology and phylogeny," upon "the causes of serial and
bilateral symmetry," and upon the "rhythmic nature" of the cleavage
of an egg. Yet this period was also, and pre-eminently, one
of acquisition of hard-earned and detailed facts. The development
of Pulmonates and Lamellibranchs, of Crustacea and of Medus&aelig;, as
well as of the marvels of Salpa's life history, became absorbing
studies.</p>

<p>This great field of the morphology of nonvertebrates could be
properly worked only with access to the marine fauna, and at that
date there were few facilities for seaside study in America. A true
disciple of Louis Agassiz, Professor Brooks saw the need of a marine
laboratory, and devoted himself, as Dohrn did at Naples, to the
accomplishment of an end so necessary for the advance of natural
science. Encouraged by the aid of a few citizens of Baltimore, in
1878 there was started an experiment&mdash;"The Chesapeake Zo&ouml;logical
Laboratory," at Fort Wool, Va., with Professor Brooks as
director. With the absolute devotion of its director to research
as example, and with the liberal aid of the trustees of the Johns
Hopkins University, this laboratory became a most important adjunct
to the university and a virile center of zo&ouml;logical study. So
great was its success as a factor in the advance of zo&ouml;logical knowledge
that the trustees bravely continued to support it whenever
financial disaster did not rob them of the last penny. For eight
years in the Chesapeake, or in the remoter waters of North Carolina,
the station flourished; then, in 1886, we find the director, with
a few enthusiastic students, venturing in a small schooner to the
but little known Bahama Island, Green Turtle Cay, there to enlarge
their experiences with such delightful realization of naturalists'
dreams of the tropics as Haeckel experienced in his Journey
to Ceylon. Subsequent annual expeditions to Nassau, the Bemini<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
Islands, and to various parts of Jamaica served as marked eras in
the lives of many young naturalists who will not soon forget the
contact with life thus obtained.</p>

<p>From these sources and from his connection with the United
States Fish Commission, as director of the Marine Station at Woods
Holl, Mass., in 1888, Professor Brooks drew inspiration and fact for
the work and thought by which he is so well known to the working
naturalist. There are few great divisions of the animal kingdom
that have not excited his special interest and claimed his long-sustained
labor upon the problems they express. Like McCrady,
deeply fascinated by the <i>Hydromedus&aelig;</i> and their wonderful changes,
many smaller papers, as well as the Memoir of the Boston Society
of Natural History, entitled The Life History of the <i>Hydromedus&aelig;</i>
and the Origin of Alternation of Generations, testify to his success
in unraveling plots that thickened with new discoveries.</p>

<p>An early interest in the mollusca, shown by his doctor's dissertation
upon the embryology of the fresh-water mussels, printed in
part in the Proceedings of the American Association, 1875, continued
to be expressed in his contributions to many problems in
the embryology of the fresh-water Pulmonates, of Gasteropods, of
Lamellibranchs, and of the Squid. The Crustacea also rightly
claimed a large share of the attention of a philosophic naturalist,
bringing him face to face with the rigid formulations of law which
these creatures present. The discovery of the very exceptional
method of cleavage in the egg of the decapod Lucifer, and the demonstration
of the existence of a free Nauplius stage there (published
in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1882),
marked a most important advance in the morphological interpretation
of all Crustacea, and brought its author to the first rank as
an authority upon this much-studied group. Studying and capturing
at Beaufort those phantom-like sand burrowers, the Squilla,
gained him an insight into and an interest in this strange division
of Crustacea that enabled him to undertake that difficult task, the
description of Stomatopods collected by the Challenger Expedition&mdash;a
task completed in 1886. The report, published in such a magnificent
series as only the British Government could have consummated,
is noticeable for the author's clear, free illustration of
the creatures described and classified. In it we find a classification
of the numerous, weird, glassy larv&aelig;, agreeing with the classification
of the adults and marking the success of the solution of the
problem&mdash;the reference of chance collections of various stages of
many species to their proper places in the life history of each species.</p>

<p>When the fever for ancestral trees had spread among naturalists
in a much more virulent form than that endemic in Wales, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
the Ascidians were brought into line as ancestral vertebrates, it was
no wonder to find Professor Brooks laboring upon these interesting
creatures, but his work in this group started from a different
point of view. As early as 1875, when studying in the laboratory
of Alexander Agassiz, he contributed to the Boston Society of Natural
History a description involving a most novel interpretation of the
embryology of a remarkable Ascidian, Salpa. This form is known
to many not naturalists as that beautiful animal chain which is sometimes
so common in the clear waters of Newport Harbor as to be
dipped up in every bucket of water, but more often not there at all.
The female buds forth male branches and gives each an egg (which
is fertilized to form a second generation of females). There is thus
no alteration of sexual and non-sexual generations at all; and, with
characteristic appreciation of a paradox, Professor Brooks subsequently
emphasized the fact that the poet naturalist Chamisso, in
discovering, in 1814, "Alternation of Generations" in Salpa, had
discovered a phenomenon where it did not exist, though subsequently
found common enough in many other animals. With the
continuity of interest so marked in him, the life history of Salpa,
as thus revealed, continued to be one of the living thoughts in Professor
Brooks's mind for a long period of years, and, with the accumulation
of material and results of researches afforded by his summer
work, culminated in the monograph Salpa&mdash;a quarto of nearly
four hundred pages and fifty odd plates&mdash;published in 1893, or after
nearly twenty years of sustained interest in this complex problem.
In this volume we find first a coherent view of the intricate life
history of this animal illuminated by such metaphors as make the
necessary technicalities both readable and thinkable. For instance,
"A chain of Salpa may be compared to two chains of cars on two
parallel tracks, placed so that the middle of each car on one track
is opposite the ends of two cars of the other track, and each joined
by two couplings to the car in front of it on its own track, and in
the same way to the one behind it, and also to those diagonally in
front of it and behind it on the other track." Again, in speaking of
that startling process of egg development that makes the embryology
of Salpa one of the apparently insoluble problems of this branch of
inquiry, he says: "Stated in a word, the most remarkable peculiarity
of the Salpa embryology is this: It is blocked out in follicular cells,
which form layers and undergo foldings and other changes which
result in an outline or model of all the general features in the organization
of the embryo. While these processes are going on the
development of the blastomeres is retarded, so that they are carried
into their final position in the embryo while still in a rudimentary
condition. Finally, when they reach the places they are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
occupy, they undergo rapid multiplication and growth and build
up the tissues of the body, while the scaffolding of follicle cells is
torn down and used up as food for the true embryonic cells. An
imaginary illustration may help to make the subject clear. Suppose
that while carpenters are building a house of wood the brick-makers
pile clay on the boards as they are carried past, and shape
the lumps of clay into bricks as they find them scattered through
the building where they have been carried with the boards. Now,
as the house of wood approaches completion, imagine the bricklayers
build a brick house over the wooden framework and not from
the bottom upward, but here and there wherever the bricks are to
be found, and that as fast as parts of the brick house are finished
the wooden one is torn down. To make the analogy complete we
must imagine that all the structure which is removed is assimilated
by the bricks, and is thus turned into the substance of new bricks to
carry on the construction."</p>

<p>Following that descriptive portion of the work comes a most interesting
interweaving of facts gathered in wide experience with
a scientific imagination possible only to one who had lived and
thought in close sympathetic contact with tropical marine life. It
is an account of the present conditions of life along tropical shores
and the probable steps that led to the evolution of the innumerable
sedentary and creeping things from the ancestral forms that floated
on the surface of the ocean before there were shores. Charming
reading for the layman, and for the specialist a broadening poetic
insight into life as it is and as it was when the world was young and
the pelagic forbears of the vertebrates competed with their simpler
associates in the annexation of the bottom as a vantage ground for
the "benevolent assimilation" of later immigrants. The third
portion of the work follows a most commendable plan: "Scientific
controversy is so unprofitable that I shall try to make it as subordinate
as possible, that the reader may devote all his attention to
the life history of Salpa, without interruption at every point where
my own observations confirm or contradict the statements of
others." This section deals with the refutation of criticism of the
author's interpretations, and endeavors to harmonize the discords
that in this, as in all complex morphological research, make progress
slow though surer.</p>

<p>The above brief references to the research work of the subject
of this sketch would be too incomplete did we omit mention of his
papers upon that very interesting and extremely ancient inhabitant
of the Chesapeake, the Lingula, or of the beautifully illustrated
memoir of the National Academy of Sciences, describing the crania
of the Lucayan Indians, an unfortunate race of gentle beings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
discovered by the Spaniards and treated as part of the live stock of
the New World and soon annihilated, leaving but a few bones, and,
as Professor Brooks tells us, our familiar and pleasant word "hammocks,"
as evidences of their having been.</p>

<p>Coming to maturity in the period of general acceptance of the
Darwinian hypothesis of organic evolution, Professor Brooks was
naturally deeply influenced, and no one who has read his works can
doubt his allegiance to natural selection as a powerful factor in the
formation of the present order of living things. In the American
Naturalist for 1877 he published the first outlines of a provisional
hypothesis of pangenesis that sought to "combine the hypotheses
of Owen, Spencer, and Darwin in such a way as to escape the objections
to which each is in itself liable, and at the same time to retain
all that renders them valuable." In 1883 the same hypothesis&mdash;that
variations are perpetuated chiefly through the male line by
special gemmules, and that the female is essentially conservative&mdash;was
elaborated in book form under the title of The Law of Heredity.</p>

<p>Thenceforth, in intervals of research work, Professor Brooks
has contributed to various periodicals, notably the Popular Science
Monthly, such essays upon kindred topics as spontaneously
arose in his mind in connection with current work here and abroad.
Some of these of a general philosophical interest have been incorporated
with lectures, originally given to students in Baltimore, as
The Foundations of Zo&ouml;logy, brought out this year by the Macmillan
Company as Volume V of the Columbia University Biological Series.
This, it will be noted, is dedicated "To Hobart College, where I
learned to study, and, I hope, to profit by, but not blindly to follow,
the writings of that great thinker on the principles of science,
George Berkeley," and its keynote might be said to be difficult to
hold, expressing the standpoint of one who says "The proof that
there is no necessary antagonism between mechanical explanations
of human life and belief in volition and duty and moral responsibility
seems to me to be very simple and easy to understand."</p>

<p>Though thus active in pushing forward the limit of fact and
theory in the domain of pure science, Professor Brooks has not
shirked the duty that falls to every member of society, but has
labored earnestly to build a sound basis for immediate practical application
of zo&ouml;logical research. In 1876 he organized a summer
zo&ouml;logical laboratory for teachers and others in Cleveland, with
the co-operation of two other young Clevelanders&mdash;A. H. Tuttle,
now Professor of Biology in the University of Virginia, and I. B.
Comstock, Professor of Geology in the University of Arizona.</p>

<p>Identifying himself with the interests of the community in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
which he had cast his lot, he interested himself in the establishment
of such educational influences as that of a public aquarium, and it
was through no fault of the sower that the seed laboriously sown
fell upon stony ground. In the winter of 1880 he gave a course
of lectures and of laboratory work for teachers in the schools of
Baltimore.</p>

<p>Again, his early studies of the development of the oyster (for
which he was awarded the medal of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'Acclimatisation
of Paris in 1883), his discovery that the American oyster could be
reared like fish from artificially fertilized eggs, since he found it
to have a different life history from its European fellow, led him
to realize the greater possibilities that awaited our oyster industries
when they should be based upon scientific fact. Living amid
a population dependent to no small extent upon these industries,
Professor Brooks threw himself with enthusiasm into the problem
of warding off the ruin that comes to every enterprise expanding
faster than its capital is replenished, and eagerly sought the means
to magnify without deterioration so important a factor in the existence
of the Commonwealth. As chairman of the Oyster Commission
appointed by the General Assembly of Maryland in 1882,
he drew up the long, detailed, and well-illustrated report, issued in
1884, which set forth the condition of the oyster beds in the Chesapeake
Bay and their deterioration from overwork, and suggested
a legislative remedy in the form of a bill designed to remove this
industry from that primitive, barbaric stage in which our communal
ownership of migrant birds and fish still remains, and to place it
upon the secure basis of personal ownership underlying other live-stock
business. But it is difficult to change the customs of centuries'
standing, and prophets rarely see the fulfillment of their predictions.
Many lectures and the issue of a popular book&mdash;The Oyster,
1891&mdash;were necessary labors assumed by Professor Brooks before
the public mind was educated to some appreciation of the nature
of the problem, and the fruits of his labors are yet to be matured
and gathered.</p>

<p>But it is not so much by discovery of new facts or by aid to
the community in which one may chance to live that a man exerts
his best influence upon mankind; rather by his success in inspiring
others to see whatever of good there may be in his point of view
and method of attack upon old problems, that his followers may
keep alive and enlarge what he stands for in the growth of civilization.
As a teacher Professor Brooks has exerted a powerful influence
by the stimulus of example in his whole-hearted devotion
to research, by originality of suggestion, and by his clear intuition
of the essential factors in morphological problems. Convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
that naturalists, like poets, are born and not made&mdash;or, if so, then
self-made&mdash;his teaching has been free from that too easily acquired
hallucination that the forcible introduction of facts, and frequent
extraction of words by means of examination, are a possible means
to the making of zo&ouml;logists, or what you will to order, to be ticketed
and branded as such after a fixed term of the above process. Those
who are strong enough to grow in the open have found in him a
genial sunshine, but those needing hothouse forcing have sometimes
missed, perhaps, the care necessary to bring them to a marketable
state.</p>

<p>Many who have followed his lectures will recall the clearness
and simplicity with which complex and puzzling questions were presented
to their minds; the skull of the bony fish soon lost its terrors,
while the homologies of the limb bones were brought to the mind
in a graphic way, sure to leave a deep impression. Directness and
lucidity, with freedom from investment of unessentials, are characteristics
of his teaching and prominent features in his too little
known Handbook of Marine Zo&ouml;logy, which, despite technical faults,
was so original and honest, so free from closet natural history, that
it marked an era in the advance of biological instruction. It was
a direct appeal to the concrete study of living animals at a time
when zo&ouml;logy for students was still the learning of text-books, and
text-books were too often in spirit but modernizations of Pliny or
of Aldrovandus.</p>

<p>It is this removal of the impeding paraphernalia of custom-bound
authority, and a direct, childlike communion with Nature
in search of truth by one's unaided labor, that this man has to offer
to those who come under his sway as teacher; with what success
will be evident from the work of those who recently united to honor
his fiftieth birthday with a portrait that might recall him to them
as he taught them, and from the work of those who, in coming years,
will enjoy the privilege of contact with his genius and be led to
"seek admission to the temple of natural knowledge naked and not
ashamed, like little children."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Forestry</span>, Professor Fernow said in his paper at the American Association,

problem quite unlike any other that presents itself to the business man.
The trees ripen slowly, a full century often being necessary to the complete
development of growth. Obviously it would be inadvisable to cut
down the product and then wait a hundred years for further income from

in trees which are in a condition to cut, while the principal, the forest
itself, remains always practically intact.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Editor's Table.</h2>


<h3><i>PRIMITIVE MAN.</i></h3>

<p>Two articles contributed to the
April and May numbers of the
Fortnightly Review by Mr. J. G.
Frazer, the learned author of The
Golden Bough, and more recently of
a monumental edition of Pausanias,
are worthy of the close attention of
all who are interested in the early
history of mankind. The articles are
entitled The Origin of Totemism,
and the object of the writer is to show
that on this obscure subject a flood
of light has been shed by the lately
published researches of Messrs. Spencer
and Gillen into the beliefs and
practices of the native tribes of central
Australia, those tribes being
perhaps the best representatives
now anywhere surviving of the most
primitive condition of the human
race. Mr. Baldwin Spencer, formerly
a Fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford,
is at present Professor of Biology in
the University of Melbourne, while
Mr. Gillen is a special magistrate in
South Australia, charged with the
protection of the aborigines. In their
work, Mr. Frazer observes, "We possess
for the first time a full and authentic
account of thoroughly primitive
savages living in the totem stage
and practically unaffected by European
influence. Its importance," he
adds, "as a document of human history
can, therefore, hardly be overestimated."</p>

<p>Evolution, it has often been remarked,
and is again remarked by the
writer of these articles, is an outcome
of the struggle for life, and is rapid
and vigorous or slow and feeble, according
to the intensity of the struggle
and the number and variety of
the competing elements. Among the
great land masses of our planet Australia
is the smallest; and, owing to
this circumstance, and also to its
physical conformation, which renders
large areas unfit for the maintenance
of life, population has been
much restricted and competition has
been at a minimum. Hence the extremely
backward and undeveloped
condition of its native tribes, a condition
which enables us, as Mr. Frazer
observes, to detect humanity in
the chrysalis stage, and mark the first
blind gropings of our race after liberty
and light.</p>

<p>The account given of these tribes
contains indeed some very remarkable
details. For example, "though
they suffer much from cold at night
under the frosty stars of the clear
Australian heaven, the idea of using
as garments the warm furs of the
wild animals they kill and eat has
never entered into their minds."
They attribute the propagation of
the human race wholly to the action
of spirits, to whom they attribute a
fecundating power, treating as wholly
irrelevant to the matter any contact
of the sexes. The idea of natural
causation seems to be one which
they have no power to grasp. They
believe that various results are dependent
on special antecedent conditions,
but it is a pure matter of
accident what they shall conceive
the conditions in any case to be.
Here we come to the origin of totemism.
Heretofore totemism has
been considered, broadly speaking,
as the identification of themselves
by some group of savages with a
particular plant or animal or other
manifestation of the powers of Nature,
accompanied by a complete or
partial <i>taboo</i>, so far as the group in
question is concerned, of the animal
or other object adopted as totem,
and also by a rule prohibiting
marriage within the group. What
Messrs. Spencer and Gillen have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
succeeded in doing has been to observe
and detect the significance of certain
practices of the Australian tribes
which have never been observed, or
at least never understood, before.</p>

<p>At a certain time of the year, it
appears, each totemistic tribe goes
through elaborate ceremonies of a
purely magical character for the purpose
of promoting the growth and
multiplication of the particular animal
or plant, if it be one useful for
food, with which the tribe is identified,
or of antagonizing its evil effects
if it be of a hurtful character.
As "there is scarcely an object, animate
or inanimate, to be found in
the country occupied by the natives
which does not give its name to some
totemic group of individuals," the
general scheme of things is pretty
well looked after in the various ceremonies
that are practiced by the
different groups. Attention is here
drawn to the essential difference between
religion and magic, religion
being an attempt to propitiate or
conciliate the higher powers, while
magic undertakes to coerce them.
"To the magician," as Mr. Frazer
observes, "it is a matter of indifference
whether the cosmic powers are
conscious or unconscious, spiritual
or material; for in either case he imagines
that he can force them by his
enchantments to do his bidding."
The ceremonies of the native Australians,
as we have said, are wholly
magical. They have the same kind
of faith in their incantations and
other strange performances that the
modern man of science has in the
preparations he makes for a physical
experiment. The difference is that
imagination or the crudest kind of
symbolism has suggested the methods
of the savage, while a careful scrutiny
and comparison of facts has dictated
those of the man of science.
The <i>proprium</i> of the savage mind is
an utter insensibility to evidence, or
rather a lack of all power of conceiving
what evidence is, and therefore
a total incapacity for feeling any
need of it. The scientific man, on
the other hand, feels that he needs it
every hour and every moment.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to quote the
description given by Mr. Frazer,
after Messrs. Spencer and Gillen, of
the ceremonies performed by the men
whose totem is the "witchetty grub,"
a creature much prized as an article
of diet by the natives.</p>

<p>"The men of the witchetty-grub
totem repair to a shallow cave in a
ravine where lies a large block of
quartzite, surrounded by some small
rounded stones. The large block represents
the full-grown grub; the
small stones stand for the eggs. On
reaching the cave the head man of
the totem group begins to sing, while
he taps the large block with a wooden
trough, such as is used for scooping
the earth out of burrows. All the
other men at the same time tap it
with twigs of a particular gum tree,
chanting the while. The burden of
their song is an invitation to the insect
to go and lay eggs. Next, the
leader takes up one of the smaller
stones, representing an egg, and
strikes each man in the stomach with
it, saying, 'You have eaten much
food,' after which he butts at the
man's stomach with his forehead....
Ceremonies of the same sort are
performed at ten different places.
When the round has been completed
the party returns home. Here, at
some distance from the camp, a long
structure of boughs has been got
ready; it is designed to represent the
chrysalis from which the full-grown
insect emerges. Into this structure
the men, each with the sacred design
of the totem painted in red ochre and
pipe clay on his body, enter and sing
of the grub in the various stages of
its development. After chanting
thus for a while they shuffle out of
the mock chrysalis one by one, with
a gliding motion, singing all the time
about the emergence of the real insect
out of the real chrysalis, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
which their own performance is
clearly an imitation."</p>

<p>The Emu men have their own
ceremonies, equally elaborate and
quite as well adapted to promote the
multiplication of emus as those of
the witchetty-grub men to produce
an abundance of witchetty grubs.
The earnestness which is thrown into
these ceremonies is beyond all question;
and it seems to be clear that
each totemic group in turn takes up
its own burden of social responsibility:
each has its duty to the tribe as
a whole, and performs it to the best
of its ability. Through their united
efforts, as they firmly believe, the various
processes of Nature are maintained
in satisfactory activity; the
succulent grub comes forth in due
season and in reasonable quantity;
the emu, the kangaroo, the bandicoot,
and other useful animals keep up
their numbers and continue to furnish
food for the community; the
hakea flower and the manna of the
mulga tree grow in normal abundance;
the winds blow; the streams
flow; the clouds yield rain and the
sun goes on shining by day and the
stars by night, with, on the whole, an
admirable regularity. A more satisfactory
system it would really be difficult
to conceive. How absurd, not
to say profane, it would be for any
one to suggest that ceremonies which
were so abundantly justified by
results might without danger be
omitted! Skepticism is indeed very
much out of place in certain stages
of human development.</p>

<p>The interesting feature, however,
as Mr. Frazer holds, in the descriptions
given by the two Australian
writers we have named is the proof
they afford that totemism, instead of
being an irrational, unexplainable
aberration of the nascent intellect of
man, was really a scheme for securing
the greatest possible multiplicity
of benefits for the savage community.
The whole tribe was divided into
groups, and each group undertook to
look after some function of Nature
and keep it up to the mark. Here
was a notable step in the direction of
division of labor. How it came
about that the particular animal or
plant which was the totem of a group
became wholly or partially <i>taboo</i> to
the group is not very easily explained;
but it seems not impossible
that some sense of tribal duty, gradually
developed, kept those who were
credited with providing any particular
food element from being themselves
greedy consumers of it. So
far as that article was concerned they
may have felt themselves as sustaining
somewhat the character of hosts
or entertainers of the tribe, and it
may thus have become the custom
that they should either not partake
at all of that special thing, or partake
of it only sparingly. If so, we find
the foundations already laid both of
politeness and of morality. It is an
interesting question how far the notions
which have been described have
died out of modern civilized society.
That they are wholly extinct it would
be rash to affirm. There are many
traces, indeed, of the surviving influence
of symbolism, and here and
there lingering tendencies toward a
belief in magic are easily discoverable.
Perhaps the wisest of us may
learn to understand ourselves a little
better by studying the operations of
the human mind in its very earliest
stages, before reason had yet shaken
itself free from the random suggestions
of sense.</p>


<h3><i>THE BOSTON PUBLIC LIBRARY AND SCIENCE.</i></h3>

<p>Apropos of the recent notable
issue, by the Boston Public Library,
of a comprehensive Bibliography of
the Anthropology and Ethnology of
Europe, to accompany Professor Ripley's
Races of Europe, the twofold
and diversely opposed interests of a
great institution of this sort are
called to mind. On the one hand are
its manifold obligations to the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
mass of the public, to the average
reader, to the ubiquitous novel and
fiction consumer, to private clubs,
and to school children. A field of activity
and value in popular education
is involved, scarcely secondary to
that of the public schools, appealing
to the general reader, the taxpayer,
and, above all, to the well-wisher for
democratic political institutions and
representative government in the future.
In stimulating work of this
character in Boston, in bringing the
Public Library into deserved prominence
among the educational institutions
of the community, Mr. Herbert
Putnam achieved great and deserved
success during his administration,
winning commendation upon all
sides.</p>

<p>The second aspect of public library
duty is revealed by the recent
undertaking at Boston above mentioned.
It concerns the relations of
great libraries to science, to original
research, not to the average reader,
but to the specialist. Instead of the
purchase of twenty copies of David
Harum, or perhaps of A Bloodthirsty
and Self-laudatory History of the
Recent Spanish War, by One who
killed fifty men with his own hand,
to meet a sudden demand on the part
of readers, the expenditure of perhaps
an equal sum of money for some
rare and costly work in a foreign
language, intelligible to but half a
hundred men in the entire city, is
involved. Such obligations do not
of course rest upon libraries of secondary
size and importance. Their
path of duty is clearly marked out
for them in the interests of the public,
both on the score of financial
ability and of demand as well. With
the leading libraries of the country
the case is different. Our universities
are fast taking rank with the
very best in Europe. Specialists in
science and technology, the peers of
those abroad, are plentiful on every
hand. Oftentimes their private
means are as limited as their appreciation
and ambition are great.
Without these rare books&mdash;the tools
of their trade&mdash;they are powerless.
In former days they were denied the
opportunity for research, or else were
obliged to spend months of study in
Europe. We have the men and the
minds here in America now; there
is every indication that the books
and apparatus are speedily becoming
available as well.</p>

<p>This Bibliography of the Boston
Public Library is a case in point. A
collection of works relating to the
physical history, the origins, migrations,
and languages of the peoples of
Europe is indicated upon its shelves,
in all probability, we venture to predict,
superior to any single one existing
in Europe. This startling statement
is based upon several considerations
familiar to any specialist.
Scientific book materials are of two
classes. The first are the expensive
and compendious volumes, generally
to be found in great libraries, although
oftentimes the paucity of
their scientific collections is very surprising,
especially in all that concerns
the newer sciences of biology,
anthropology, and the like. The second
order of publications, often rarer
and scientifically more valuable than
the first, are the scattered monographs
or pamphlets published in all
manner of forms and by societies,
oftentimes ephemeral and of all degrees
of eminence. This second
class of materials is generally richly
represented in the collections of the
various scientific societies, especially
in the form of reprints presented by
the authors. But the great and expensive
tomes are seldom thus presented,
and the societies can seldom
afford to purchase them. Thus it
comes about that these two classes of
raw materials have to be separately
hunted down, being rarely found together.
For example, the library of
the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'Anthropologie at Paris,
judging by its printed catalogues,
while abounding in scattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
monographs and reprints, contains very
few of the expensive volumes. One
must seek these, and if they be in
English or German, very likely in
vain, in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale.</p>

<p>The Public Library of the city
of Boston has apparently tried an experiment
in this direction, and is
certainly to be congratulated upon
the result. To a very rich collection
of standard works has been added,
by co-operation with a special investigator,
a large part of the <i>flotsam</i>
and <i>jetsam</i> which is of such extreme
value to the student of original
sources. The library has set a worthy
example of encouragement to research;
it has offered definite proof
of the ability of our American institutions
to rival their European contemporaries.
And a peculiarly appropriate
rounding-out to the successful
career in the distinctively
popular phases of administration of
the institution of the late librarian,
Mr. Herbert Putnam, is afforded in
this work, the last at Boston officially,
perhaps, to bear his signature
and the stamp of his approval.</p>


<h3><i>OUR RACE TROUBLES.</i></h3>

<p>The article which we publish in
the present number of the Monthly,
under the title of The Race Problem
in the United States, is a sequel to
one which appeared in the May number
entitled The Negro Question.
Both writers have a special acquaintance
with the subject, and are widely
known as active workers for the elevation
of the negro race&mdash;Mr. Booker
T. Washington, the writer of the second
article, being himself one of its
most distinguished representatives.
While both manifest abundant sympathy
with the negro, and a deep
sense of the pressing nature of the
problems to which the presence of a
large negro element in the population
of certain of our States gives rise,
they virtually acknowledge that it is
extremely difficult in discussing the
subject to do more than present a
few broad general views. That there
is a very bad condition of things
in some of our Southern States no
one will dispute. The crimes which
have been committed by white men,
in avenging real or supposed crimes
committed by black men, stamp
a character of utter savagery on the
communities in which they have occurred,
and in which they have remained
unpunished. At the same time
there is no doubt that the existence
of so large a negro element in the
South constitutes a serious obstacle
to the moral and intellectual as well
as to the economic development of
that part of the country, and tends
to keep alive a dangerous condition
of public feeling. Our contributor,
Dr. Curry, states significantly that
he could give very impressive details
on this point, were it not that it
would furnish altogether too unpleasant
reading.</p>

<p>What are we going to do about
it? No doubt we have before us an
illustration of the old adage, "The
fathers have eaten sour grapes, and
the children's teeth are set on edge."
The South had its "peculiar institution"
for some generations, and held
to it with extraordinary tenacity&mdash;went
to war rather than give it up.
Now, by the simple force of events,
the old patriarchal and slaveholding
system is broken up, and there the
former slaves and their descendants
are&mdash;emancipated citizens who have
their rights under the Constitution,
and who therefore have to be reckoned
with. They can not be deported
against their will; they have
the same right to live in the country
that any white man has.</p>

<p>Manifestly there is but one honorable
way of dealing with the
blacks, and that is to treat them
with absolute justice. Upon this
point we are in entire agreement
with Mr. Booker T. Washington. If
a black man is excluded from the
suffrage on account of his ignorance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
let the equally ignorant white man
be equally excluded. We have great
faith in the educative effect of justice,
and a firm administration of
law. It would at once raise the self-respect
of the negro to know that
what was law for the white man was
law for him, and <i>vice versa</i>; and
self-respect is a sure ground for
further advance. In the matter of
education, we hold that education
for the colored race should
be almost wholly of a practical
kind. We go further, and say
that the education given to white
children everywhere might with
great advantage be much more practical
than it is. The proper education
for any individual is that which
will tend to make him more efficient,
successful, and self-sufficing in the
position which he is called to occupy.
This principle, far from implying a
stationary condition of the individual,
is precisely the one which provides
best for his advancement. It
is the man who is thoroughly competent
for the work he has at any
given moment to do who passes beyond
that work to something better.
The misery of existing systems of
education is that to so large extent
they educate for a hypothetical position
beyond that for which an immediate
preparation is necessary. The
result is that the schools unload
upon the community year by year a
levy of adventurous youths who at
once begin to live by their wits in
no very creditable sense, and who
constitute a distinct menace to the
stability of society.</p>

<p>We would therefore urge most
earnestly upon all who take an interest
in the education of the colored
race to keep in view above all things
the importance and necessity of fitting
the negro to take an active part
in the practical industries of the
country, and above all in agriculture.
An education directed mainly
to this end would do far more to develop
his intelligence than one of a
more abstract and ambitious character
and would furnish a far better
foundation for success in life. Far
from tying the negro down to manual
occupations, it would prepare the
way for his eventual participation in
all occupations. But occupation for
occupation, where is there one that
can reasonably be rated higher than
the intelligent and successful cultivation
of the soil? If the negro
problem can not be solved by common
sense and common honesty it
can not be solved at all. Before giving
it up as insoluble we should
make full proof of these homely specifics.
We have long been proclaiming
that the negro is a man and a
brother; let us therefore treat him
as such, and if we find out anything
that is particularly good for
his moral and intellectual improvement,
let us try a little of it ourselves.
It surely will not do us any
harm.</p>

<h3>SPECIAL BOOKS.</h3>

<p><i>The Lesson of Popular Government</i><a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> is a fruit of thirty years' study,
by Mr. <i>Bradford</i>, of certain peculiarities in the political workings of our
institutions. The book is not for those who consider it patriotic to shut
their eyes to whatever is going wrong, but for those whose regard for the
Federal Constitution and the organization of our governments is only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
increased by the consciousness of the strain to which they are exposed, and
who feel strongly that while the principles of the Government and the character
of the people "are still sound and reliable, some modifications and
readjustments of the machinery must take place, unless we are to drift
through practical anarchy and increasing corruption to military despotism."
For the sake of putting the subject in a clearer light, the three
more prominent approaches to democratic government in modern times&mdash;those
of England, France, and the United States&mdash;are studied comparatively
in the former part of the work. The carrying on of governments
in accordance with the expressed wish of the people is spoken of in the beginning
as the appearance of a new force which has changed the whole
face of society, and points to still greater changes in the future. How it
has worked in the three countries in which it has been in operation for a
little more than a century, and what it has done, are the questions which
the author undertakes to answer. In England, popular government has
taken the form, with a powerless hereditary sovereign commanding universal
loyalty, of a ministry responsible to a Parliament, which is directly
responsible to the people. In France, the executive is controlled by a legislative
body chosen by universal suffrage, the majority of which is held
together by party discipline. The virtue of this government is undergoing
a supreme test in the Dreyfus case, the right issue of which would show
a greater proportional advance in true liberty and the justification of popular
government than has taken place in any other nation. In the United
States, power is passing more and more into Congress, a body chosen separately
from the President, whose members are actuated by personal, local,
and partisan motives, and rarely rise to the conception of broad national
views or look further than to the immediate present, while the nation
at large and the Executive are without representation such as insures the
co-operation of the ministry and Parliament in England. In all other
respects than appointments to office, which must be made "in strict subordination
to the demands of members of his party in both Houses of Congress,"
the recognized power of the Executive is confined within very narrow
limits. In matters of legislation he has no voice whatever beyond
general recommendations, such as are open to any citizen, and to which
Congress pays little or no attention. In fact, that body resents anything
like an expression of opinion from the President. The system is not encouraging
to the filling of the office by men of the first rank, and men of
that rank seldom reach it. The House of Representatives, meeting every
two years a new body, suffers from its entire want of coherency and the
absence of a qualified leader, and falls an easy prey to the lobbyist and the
boss. So, while "there are still many, perhaps the majority, of men of
good character in public life, the tendency is steadily downward." It has
been customary in some quarters to charge the evils we suffer upon universal
suffrage, but Mr. Bradford maintains that it is this which to-day
is keeping up the character of the Government, and that but for the
restraints imposed by it our political condition would be a great deal
worse than it is. Further light is sought upon the situation, and further
pictures are given of the conditions existing in comprehensive reviews of
the State and municipal governments of the country. In considering proposed
remedies the referendum is dismissed as tending to destroy personality
and diffuse responsibility even more than is done now&mdash;the reverse of
the concentration of executive power as the only really indispensable part
of the Government, which should be sought. The enforcement of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
principle of executive supremacy with immediate responsibility is the
purpose of the book. Mr. Bradford would obtain this by giving the representatives
of the administrative departments seats in the House, with power
to suggest legislation, make explanations, and participate in debate. His
final argument is that it can not be charged that democracy is a failure;
but, "with a wholly new force introduced into the world, the proper machinery
for its application has not yet been employed. In its nature it
is reasonable, sound, and, on the whole, beneficent." Using the words of
an English writer, "the failures of government in the United States are
not the result of democracy, but of the craftiest combination of schemes
to defeat the will of democracy ever devised in the world."</p>

<p>We have already published a fairly comprehensive review of <i>Richard
Semon's In the Australian Bush</i>,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> based upon the German original, by
Prof. E. P. Evans, in the fifty-second volume of the Monthly (November,
1897). But little needs to be added to what Professor Evans has said of
the book besides announcing the appearance of the English edition, the
translation for which was written under the author's own superintendence,
and the contents of which do not differ in any important particular from
the German impression. Professor Semon went to Australia on a special
zo&ouml;logical mission, and spent two years there. His purpose was the study of
the wonderful Australian fauna, the oviparous mammals, marsupials, and
ceratodus (lungfish). These animals represent forms which, with a few
notable exceptions, have long since become extinct in other countries, where
they have to be studied in such parts of their bony forms as happen to have
been preserved in the rocks, while here they can be examined alive and in
the flesh&mdash;"living fossils," as the author fittingly calls them, links between
the present age and one of the geological periods of the past. His observations
on these subjects are in course of publication in a special scientific
work, not quite half of which has appeared. The present volume consists
in the notes of travel and adventure, the dealing with men, the anthropological
studies, and what we might call the <i>obiter</i> observations of the expedition.
Almost simultaneously with Professor Semon's narrative we
have from the same publishers another book, on <i>The Native Tribes of Central
Australia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> which deals more fully, exclusively, and perhaps more expertly
with the anthropology of a part of the Australian continent. Of the
authors, Mr. <i>Gillen</i> has spent the greater part of the past twenty years in
the center of the continent, and as sub-protector of the aborigines has had
exceptional opportunities of coming in contact with the Arunta tribe; and
both of them have been made fully initiated members of that tribe. Though
both about Australia, the two books do not cover the same ground. Australia
is very large, and its physical conditions are such that the groups
of tribes inhabiting the various regions have for a long period of time been
isolated from one another and have followed different lines in development.
Professor Semon's observations were made in the Burnett district
of northeastern Queensland, while those recorded in the work of Spencer
and Gillen were made in the very center of South Australia and of the continent.
Consequently, in reading them we read really about different
things. In addition to the investigation of various customs, such as those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
connected with initiation and magic, special attention has been paid by
Messrs. Spencer and Gillen to the totemic system and to matters connected
with the social organization of the tribes; and here again the authors insist
upon the differences between the groups of tribes, and that the customs
of no one tribe or group can be taken as typical of Australia generally in
any other sense than as broad outline. Both works deal with considerable
fullness with the institution of marriage among the Australians, and the
customs by which too close intermarriage is prevented. Among other subjects
treated with especial fullness by Messrs. Spencer and Gillen are the
totems, the bull-roarers, the Intichuma ceremonies (associated with the
totems), the initiation ceremonies, customs relative to the knocking out
of teeth, traditions, burial and mourning, spirit individuals, medicine men
and magic, methods of obtaining wives, myths, clothing, weapons, implements,
decorative art, and names. Professor Semon formed a moderate
opinion of the capacity of the Australians. Though coarse and heavy, their
faces are not bad looking and have expression. They are "no link between
monkeys and men, but human creatures through and through," though of
one of the lowest types. They have no pottery, no agriculture, no abstract
ideas of any kind, can not count very far, but are clever in learning to
write, read, and draw, are experts in signaling, and have their intellect
and senses "brilliantly developed in all directions bearing on the hunt,"
with great dexterity in the use of weapons.</p>


<h3>GENERAL NOTICES.</h3>

<p>Miss <i>Mary H. Kingsley</i> has given
in her <i>West African Studies</i><a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> a book
marked by pungent wit and striking
originality in its sketches of adventure
and observation, and containing in the
chapters devoted to ethnology results of
her personal studies. She was already
known by a record of her adventures of
a young Englishwoman traveling alone
through some of the worst regions of
West Africa, embodied in her book Travels
in West Africa, which was published
in the latter part of 1898. The present
book may be regarded, as its name implies,
as the result and the embodiment
of the afterthoughts of that hazardous
journey. It includes, after descriptions
in which the unconventional directness
of expression is much to be remarked, an
account of African characteristics and a
description of fishing in West Africa,
chapters of a soberer sort on fetich,
schools of fetich, witchcraft, African
medicine and the witch doctor, and historical
and economical chapters on Early
Trade, French Discovery, Commerce, the
Crown Colony System and some of its
incidents, The Clash of Cultures, and African
Property. Miss Kingsley's criticisms
of the present system of administration
being regarded as rather destructive,
she endeavors to set forth, in a
chapter entitled An Alternative Plan,
"some other way wherein the African
colonies could be managed." Special attention
is invited by the author to two
articles in the appendix to the volume
by M. le Comte C. N. de Cardi and Mr.
John Harford. We are pleased to note
the high appreciation which Miss Kingsley
expresses of the anthropological work
concerning west-coast tribes of our former
contributor, Colonel A. B. Ellis&mdash;Sir
A. B. Ellis when he died.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Frederick Palmer's In the Klondyke</i><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
is an unpretentious book and free
from the appearance of sensationalism,
but gives a clear and graphic account
of the region and its ways and of the
getting there at the breaking up of winter.
The author was at Dyea late in
February, having intended to go with a
Government relief expedition which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
found no occasion to proceed farther.
Being thus left out, he undertook, with
dogs and sledges and two companions
who proved congenial, the "untried journey"
of six hundred miles over the ice
fields of the Lewes Lakes and the ice
packs of the Yukon River, which had
been the contemplated route of the expedition.
The start was made about the
18th of March, with little time to spare,
because the Yukon was expected to become
impassable by the 20th of April.
The Chilkoot Pass was achieved in a
day, and the rest of the journey was
made "downhill with the current of the
river at the rate of eight inches to the
mile," in weather that became very variable,
with now hard freezing and now
slush in the middle of the day. The difficulties
of the journey must have been
formidable, with considerable suffering,
besides a week in a hut with the measles,
but no complaint further than the mention
of the incidents appears in the author's
story. On some of the days the
thermometer ranged from 10&deg; to 20&deg; below
zero at two o'clock in the morning,
to 80&deg; above at night, and the author
"had one ear blistered by the frost and
the other by the sun in the same day."
The party arrived at Dawson just four
days before the final break-up of the ice
in the river. Accounts corresponding in
temper and vividness with that of the
journey are given of Dawson, the miners
and mining, the history of the Klondyke
mining enterprise, Klondyke types of
character and adventure, the toils and
trials and profit and losses of the "Pilgrims,"
the workings of the Government,
and the return home to civilization&mdash;which
does not appear, after all, to have
offered transcendentally superior attractions
to those who had experienced the
pleasure of adventure.</p>

<p>The <i>History of Physics in its Elementary
Branches</i><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> has been prepared
by Professor <i>Cajori</i> in the belief that
some attention to the history of a science
helps to make it attractive, and that the
general view of the development of the
human intellect gained in reading a history
on the subject is in itself stimulating
and liberalizing. The author has had
in mind Professor Ostwald's characterization
of the absence of the historical sense
and the want of knowledge of the great
researches upon which the edifice of science
rests as a defect in the present
method of teaching. The subject is
treated by periods. In ancient times
the Greeks, while displaying wonderful
creative genius in metaphysics, literature,
and art, being ignorant of the
method of experimentation, achieved
relatively little in natural science. The
Roman scientific writers were contented
to collect the researches of Greek professors.
Except in a few instances the
Arabs did not distinguish themselves
in original research. Writers in the middle
ages were only commentators, and
knew nothing of personal investigation.
The physicist of the renascence abandoned
scholastic speculation and began
to study Nature in the language of experiment.
The seventeenth century was
a period of great experimental as well
as theoretical activity. In the eighteenth
century speculation was less effectively
restrained and guided by experiments.
The nineteenth century "has
overthrown the leading theories of the
previous one hundred years, and has
largely built anew on the older foundations
laid during the seventeenth century."
The evolution of physical laboratories,
first for teachers and then for students,
is the subject of the last chapter.</p>

<p>"The Great Commanders Series" of D.
Appleton and Company is enriched by a
biography of <i>General Sherman</i>,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> whom
the author, General <i>Manning F. Force</i>,
styles "the most picturesque figure in
our civil war." He was more than this;
he was its scholar and statesman&mdash;a man
distinguished by the possession of high
military combined with the best civil
qualities. Further, as General Force
well says, "his character was absolutely
pure and spotless." In his dealings with
the Vigilance Committee in San Francisco
he assumed a position which it required
courage of a much higher order
than a soldier's to maintain. While comfortably
situated as an honored professor
in the State Military Academy of
Louisiana when the Legislature passed
the Ordinance of Secession, he had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
hesitation in deciding what to do. He
at once gave in his resignation in a letter
that is a model of manliness, declaring
his preference "to maintain allegiance to
the Constitution of the United States as
long as a fragment of it survives." His
career as a general in the civil war is described
at length. Through it all his
foresight, seeking always to accomplish
the most with the least expenditure and
ultimate suffering, to which his strategy
was adapted, is conspicuous. At this
time and afterward his supreme thought
appears to have been as to what would
best conduce to the permanent good of
the republic. To his military ability and
self-effacing patriotism he added a far-seeing
wisdom in council that could always
be relied upon. "In his most unguarded
words his principle was always
clear, noble, and intensely patriotic, and
his careless colloquial expressions often
covered a practical wisdom and insight
of a most striking kind."</p>

<p>In preparing their <i>Text-Book of Algebra</i><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
the authors, assuming that mental
discipline is of the first importance
to every student of mathematics, have
endeavored to present the elements of
the science in a clear and logical form,
while yet keeping the needs of beginners
constantly in mind. Special attention
is given to making clear the reason
for every step taken; each principle is
first illustrated by particular examples,
and then rules and suggestions for performing
the operation are laid down.
The authors have endeavored to avoid
apparent conciseness at the expense of
clearness and accuracy, and have thereby
made their volume somewhat larger
than ordinary text-books. Features to
which attention is called are the development
of the fundamental operations
with algebraic numbers and the concrete
illustrations of these operations; the
use of type forms in multiplication and
division and in factoring; the application
of factoring to the solution of equations;
the solutions of equations based
upon equivalent equations and equivalent
systems of equations; the treatment
of irrational equations; the discussions
of general problems and the interpretation
of positive, negative, zero, intermediate,
and infinite solutions of
problems; the treatment of inequalities
and their applications; the outline of a
discussion of irrational numbers; a brief
introduction to imaginary and complex
numbers; and the great number of
graded examples and problems.</p>

<p>The material of the <i>Primary Arithmetic</i>,
Number Studies for the Second,
Third, and Fourth Grades, of <i>A. R.
Hornbrook</i> (American Book Company),
has been chosen with careful reference
to the development of the number sense
of little children, as noticed by the author
and as reported by many other
observers. A distinctive feature of the
work is the use of diagrams called
"number tables," as a concrete basis for
the child's thinking while he is getting
his first ideas of the facts of the addition
and multiplication tables. In them the
numbers up to one hundred are presented
in columns of tens, and so handled
as to exhibit to the child's conception
the relations of the several digits.
By their use he first learns the properties
of ten, then of two, and so on
of the others&mdash;not presented in regular
order, but with a view of exhibiting
special properties&mdash;and their relations
to one another. The method is ingenious
and appears useful.</p>

<p>The study on <i>Rhode Island and the
Formation of the Union</i>, of the Columbia
University Series in History, Economics,
and Public Law (The Macmillan
Company, New York), was undertaken
by Mr. <i>Frank Greene Bates</i> in
order to ascertain why Rhode Island so
long delayed its ratification of the Federal
Constitution. The delay seems to
have been largely a matter of the assertion
of State rights, in which Rhode
Island appears at that time to have been
but little, if any, behind South Carolina.
Liberty "was the presiding genius
of the spiritual life of the colony, and
the principle of freedom of conscience
was never lost sight of; and this could
not otherwise than heighten the other
characteristics of the colony&mdash;individualism."
The course pursued was the
natural outcome of the conditions of the
times, the "outcropping of the undying
love of the people of the State for democracy
and liberty, and their jealousy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
all authority outside their own boundaries."</p>

<p>"No book up to recent date," says
the author of <i>Pantheism, the Light and
Hope of Modern Reason</i>, who signs his
name <i>C. Amryc</i>, and gives no publisher's
name, "has treated pantheism as consistently
as it deserves to be treated";
and he adds that "it is no creed; it is
a logic; it makes absolutely no demand
upon 'belief'; what is not logical is rejected,
what is logical to-day is accepted,
no matter whether it was unlogical
a thousand years ago or will be
illogical a thousand years hence; we are
only responsible for our times." As pantheism,
if it is a true logic, must be applicable
to all races, the author has not
chosen his examples from one nation or
tribe; and he believes that the views he
expresses are also those of nine tenths
of what is called modern science. Many
topics are treated of, some of which
would not at first thought be associated
with an exposition of pantheism.
The matter and manner of the book are
various. Parts of it are fairly good reading;
other parts strike us as different.</p>

<p>A book on <i>The Principles of Agriculture</i>,
prepared by Prof. <i>L. H. Bailey</i> as
a text-book for schools and rural societies,
is published as a number of the
Rural Science Series of the Macmillan
Company ($1.25). In it agriculture is
treated as a business, not a science, but
as a business which is aided at every
point by a knowledge of science. "It
is on the science side that the experimenter
is able to help the farmer. On
the business side the farmer must rely
upon himself, for the person who is not
a good business man can not be a good
farmer, however much he may know of
science." The principle of the intelligent
application of knowledge is illustrated
in a remark of the author's about
the treating of drainage. The learner
is apt to begin at the wrong end of his
problem. In the usual method the pupil
or reader is first instructed in methods
of laying drains. "But drainage is not
the unit. The real unit is texture and
moisture of soils&mdash;plowing, draining,
green cropping, are methods of producing
a given or desired result. The real
subject-matter for first consideration,
therefore, is amelioration of soil, rather
than laying of drains." Professor Bailey
aims throughout this book to get at
"the real subject-matter for first consideration"
in matters relating to soils,
the plant and crops, and the animals
and stock.</p>

<p><i>Ideals and Programmes</i> (C. W. Bardeen,
Syracuse, N. Y., 75 cents) is a collection
of thoughtful and suggestive essays,
by <i>Jean L. Gourdy</i>, on the practical
side of school life and the teaching
of children. The author's ideal
seems to be that the teacher should
have a plan for her work, preparing for
it so as to have the whole course marked
out on general lines for the entire school
year. Thus, her occupation should be to
qualify herself for doing the work right.
These statements of general principles
are followed by essays on reading and
plans for teaching, correlation as "the
headstone of the corner of successful
teaching, geography, sand modeling,
field lessons, kindergarten training, and
discipline." The burden of the whole is
by skillful adaptation to get the best
possible out of every lesson, in which
a liberal use of field work assists greatly,
and above all to avoid the stiff, formal,
juiceless lessons of the old style of
teaching.</p>

<p>There have been several biographies
of Faraday, most of them now out of
print; but the life, work, methods, character,
and aims of the man&mdash;who was
"beyond all question the greatest scientific
expositor of his time"&mdash;can not be
kept too constantly or too long before the
minds of students. Welcome, therefore,
is the easily accessible and convenient
volume <i>Michael Faraday: His Life and
Work</i>, which has been prepared by Prof.
<i>Sylvanus P. Thompson</i>, and is published
by the Macmillan Company in their
Century Science Series ($1.25). The
work by which Faraday contributed so
much to the advancement of knowledge
is made prominent, and is illustrated
largely, due regard being had to the
limitations of the size of the book, with
citations from his own journal and
copies of his drawings.</p>

<p>In <i>American Indians</i>, a book second
in order but first in date of publication
of a series of "Ethno-Geographic Readers"
(D. C. Heath &amp; Co., Boston), Prof.
<i>Frederick Starr</i> has succeeded in conveying
a large amount of information
about our aborigines in a very small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
space, and has done it in a clear style
and a very satisfactory manner. The
book is intended as a reading book for
boys and girls in school, to whose tastes
and capacity it seems well adapted; but
the author will be pleased if it also interests
older readers, and hopes it may
enlarge their sympathy with our native
Americans. Besides the accounts of the
tribal divisions, general customs, manner
of life, houses, and institutions&mdash;which
when they are counted up are
found to be quite numerous&mdash;it has articles
on the sign language, medicine
men and secret societies, the mounds
and their builders, George Catlin and
his work, the cliff-dwellings and ruins of
the Southwest, the tribes of the Northwest
coast, matters of religious and
mythological significance, the Aztecs,
the Mayas, and the ruined cities of Yucatan
and Central America.</p>

<p>The revision, for the fifth edition, of
<i>H. Newell Martin's The Human Body</i>
(Henry Holt &amp; Co., New York, $1.20)
was undertaken by Prof. <i>George Wills
Fitz</i> with the idea of bringing the book
into accord with the late developments
of physiology, of simplifying the treatment
of some parts while expanding
that of others, and of giving additional
illustrations. Every effort has been
made to avoid injuring those features
of the author's work which have contributed
to making the book so favorably
known. The changes in the first
nine chapters are largely verbal; but
considerable alterations and additions
have been made in some of the succeeding
chapters. The directions for demonstrations
and experiments have been
greatly enlarged and collected into an
appendix. They include the new requirements
in anatomy, physiology, and
hygiene for admission to Harvard College
and the Lawrence Scientific School.</p>

<p>We have already noticed some of
<i>Lucy S. W. Wilson's</i> excellent Manuals
on Nature Study, particularly the one
intended for the guidance of teachers.
We now have in the same line the <i>First
Reader</i> of a series on <i>Nature Study in
Elementary Schools</i> (New York: The
Macmillan Company, 35 cents), a book
composed of original matter and selections
which has been prepared "with the
desire of putting into the hands of little
children literature which shall have for
their minds the same interest and value
that really good books have for grown-up
people." But the author does not expect
to accomplish this by merely giving
the book to the child and leaving
the reading to work out its own effect.
Each of the lessons is intended to be preceded
by a Nature lesson. During or
after the reading a lesson should be
given in the new words introduced, and
afterward the lessons should be grasped
for the sake of thought. The lessons,
which have appropriate illustrations
from Nature, present some novel features.
Among them is an apparent intention
in the original compositions to
follow the child's method of thought.</p>

<p><i>The American Elementary Arithmetic</i>
(American Book Company) is intended
by the author, Prof. <i>M. A. Bailey</i>,
to cover the first five years' work (beginning
apparently very young) in the
study, and is the first of a two-book
series. It is divided into two parts&mdash;for
the primary and for the three succeeding
grades. It contemplates the use
of apparatus, consisting of paper, pasteboard,
toy money, blocks, and splints.
The attempt is made to give every subject
twice: first in pictures, and second
in the particular form of printed words.
Mathematical conceptions are presented
in the first chapter in the order in which
they are supposed to arise in the child's
consciousness&mdash;first, once or more, indefinitely;
next, how many, by holding
up fingers, laying down sticks, etc.; and
then by words, and so on&mdash;all introductory
work designed to develop step by
step a mathematical vocabulary, and to
form a habit of clear mathematical
thinking. The laboratory plan is followed
in the succeeding chapters.</p>

<p>In the <i>Language Lessons</i> of <i>J. G.
Park</i> (American Book Company) an arrangement
of the matter is aimed at
which will draw upon the student for
such effort as may be expected at a given
stage of advancement, which will cause
him to think first and then to express
his thought with clearness and precision.
In the succeeding parts are given
exercises on language work, with special
drills upon capitalization and punctuation,
inductive lessons in grammar, and,
finally, lessons so graded that a student
may advance very readily from them
into the higher work of grammar. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
study is facilitated by the use of striking
illustrations as the basis of lessons.</p>

<p>The <i>Semi-annual Report of Schimmel
and Company</i> (Leipsic and New York),
though primarily a business document,
furnishes much information about the
industries in essential oils and fine chemicals,
and concerning progress in the
departments of chemical science relating
to these. The report for October,
1898, speaks of much research and many
valuable studies as having been carried
on during the preceding six months in
the domain of the essential oils and their
constitution, and of ample material for
scientific reports as having been gathered.</p>

<h2>Fragments of Science.</h2>


<p><b>The Gypsies and their Folk Tales.</b>&mdash;In
the introduction to his collection
of Gypsy Folk Tales Mr. Francis H.
Groome describes the wide dispersion of
the gypsy race as extending, in Europe,
from Finland to Sicily, and from the
shores of the Bosporus to the Atlantic
seaboard; in Asia, from Siberia to India,
and from Asia Minor (possibly) to
China; in Africa, from Egypt and Algeria
to Darf&uacute;r and Kordofan; and in
America, from Pictou in Canada to Rio
Janeiro. Believing that the gypsies,
originating in India, left that region at
an unknown date very long ago, he
traces their migrations in the past and
shows that a part of the race is still very
migratory, passing, among other routes,
between Scotland and North America,
and between Spain and Louisiana.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
Another migration not mentioned in his
book is the annual oscillation between
north and south of the North American
gypsy colony, which is growing healthily.
The author finds it at present quite
impossible to fix the arrival of the gypsies
in southeastern Europe at a thousand
years before Christ or a thousand
years after. If the Komodromoi of the
Byzantine writers were gypsies, then
these people must have been a recognized
and familiar element of the Balkan population
about as early as the latter date.
Gypsies pass for a very cunning people,
and such they are to outsiders, so that
Romany or gypsy guile is a very common
expression. Centuries of suspicion
and repression have taught them to arm
themselves proof against confidence in
strangers; but to those who become acquainted
with them, as Mr. Groome professes
to have done and George Borrow
did, they present a character of
simplicity and frankness. There is, as
a gypsy woman once said to a writer
in The Athen&aelig;um, "somethin' in the
mind of a Gorgio that shuts the Romany's
mouth and opens his eyes and
ears." Gypsies are active transmitters
of folklore, and have rich funds of stories;
and many believe that the folklore
stories of Europe are traceable to
Indian sources, whence they may have
been transmitted to Europe. Mr. Groome
suggests how some of these stories may
have originated by telling of a gypsy
girl he knew who dashed off "what was
almost a folk tale impromptu." She had
been to a picnic in a four-in-hand with
"a lot of real tiptop gentry," and
"Reia," she said to me afterward, "I'll
tell you the comicallest thing as ever
was. We'd pulled up to put the brake
on, and there was a <i>puro hotchiwitchi</i>
(old hedgehog) come and looked at us
through the hedge, looked at me hard.
I could see he'd his eye upon me. And
home he'd go, that old hedgehog, to his
wife, and 'Missus,' he'd say, 'what d'ye
think? I seen a little gypsy gal just now
in a coach and four horses,' and 'Dabla,'
she'd say, 'bless us, every one now keeps
a carriage.'"</p>

<p><b>Educational Work of an Experiment
Station.</b>&mdash;The survey of the
year's work of Cornell University Agricultural
Experiment Station in its efforts
to "help the farmer" by dealing
with present-day problems includes mention
of its investigations, related in bulletins
published or to be published in
reference to fruits, their insect and fungoid
enemies, vegetables, flowers, sugar
beets, potatoes, fertilizers, beans, the
dairy, veterinary science, horticulture,
and plant disease. Much of the work of
the station can not be published, consisting
as it does of correspondence, personal
advice, attending meetings, making
records, or the performance of special
illustrative experiments at farmers'
homes or in neighborhoods as object lessons.
"It is a pity," the report says,
"that every farmer in the State can not
be personally touched at least once in
his life by the methods and the inspiration
of a good teacher." The itinerant
schools which were held in the early days
of the extension work are regarded as
being most beneficial when the community
has been awakened by simpler and
more elementary means, while the larger
part of the work can be done more economically
than by them. Yet in particular
places and cases they are of greatest
value, and they are still held when
suitable conditions prevail. Special
dairy schools, largely of the nature of
practical demonstrations, were held at
various places. The report lays much
stress on the importance of beginning
the educational work with the children
and upon the value of Nature study.
More than sixteen thousand school children
have requested and been supplied
with information on the making of gardens.</p>

<p><b>Flies as Bearers of Disease.</b>&mdash;In
estimating the relative importance of
flies and water supply in spreading disease,
Dr. M. A. Veeder distinguishes between
intestinal and malarial disorders.
In the former the infection is a bacillus
of some sort, the presence of which can
be traced to contamination by excretions
from a diseased bowel. In the latter the
source of infection is peculiar to marshy
or stagnant water, and independent of
contamination from human sources. It
is the author's belief that, with relatively
unimportant exceptions, intestinal
diseases are spread almost exclusively
by flies and malarial diseases by water,
and he supports it by citations from recent
army experiences. Likewise, during
the recent British campaign in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
Fashoda, which was most carefully planned
and took place in a climate that is exceptionally
dry and hygienic, there was
no abatement of typhoid fever. In the
case of an outbreak of malignant dysentery
described by the author in a previous
paper, taken at its height, not a
new case occurred after measures were
adopted that made conveyance by flies
impossible, although there had been
fresh ones every day for some time previously.
Another more recent "lively
epidemic" of typhoid mentioned by the
author was ended in a day by measures
directed against conveyance by water.
"When flies are responsible, there are
little neighborhood epidemics, extending
in short leaps from house to house, without
reference to water supply or anything
else in common. But when water
is at fault the disease follows its use
wherever it may go.... Epidemics
spread by flies tend to follow the direction
of prevailing warm winds, as though
the fly, wandering outdoors after contact
with the source of infection, had
drifted with the wind, but nothing of
the sort is perceptible in the case of
water-borne disease."</p>

<p><b>Pottery Making and Lead Poisoning.</b>&mdash;The
report of Professors Thorpe
and Oliver on the subject of the employment
of compounds of lead in the manufacture
of pottery, especially in its relation
to the health of the work people, has
just been issued as an English blue book.
It appears that of the total male workers
in the year 1898, 4.9 per cent became
"leaded," while of the female workers
the proportion was 12.4 per cent. It is
stated that in the last six months many
successful attempts have been made by
the manufacturers to substitute a leadless
glaze, and there seems no doubt
that glazes of sufficient brilliancy, covering
power, and durability are now
within the reach of the manufacturer.
The exclusion of women from certain
parts of the work, except where leadless
glazes are used, is advocated, and
also various expedients for preventing
the absorption of the lead by the skin,
such as rubber gloves or "dipping"
tongs. Their general conclusions are
as follows: "That by far the greater
amount of earthenware of the class already
specified can be glazed without
the use of lead in any form. It has
been demonstrated, without the slightest
doubt, that the ware so made is in
no respects inferior to that coated with
lead glaze. There seems no reason,
therefore, why in the manufacture of
this class of goods the operatives should
still continue to be exposed to the evils
which the use of lead glaze entails.
There are, however, certain branches
of the pottery industry in which it
would be more difficult to dispense with
the use of lead compounds. But there
is no reason why, in these cases, the
lead so employed should not be in the
form of a fritted double silicate. Such
a compound, if properly made, is but
slightly attacked by even strong hydrochloric,
acetic, or lactic acid. There can
be little doubt that, if lead must be used,
the employment of such a compound silicate&mdash;if
its use could be insured&mdash;would
greatly diminish the evil of lead poisoning.
The use of raw lead as an ingredient
of glazing material, or as an ingredient
of colors which have to be subsequently
fired, should be absolutely prohibited.
As it would be very difficult to insure
that an innocuous lead glaze shall be
employed, we are of opinion that young
persons and women should be excluded
from employment as dippers, dippers'
assistants, ware cleaners after dippers,
and glost placers in factories where lead
glaze is used, and that the adult male
dippers, dippers' assistants, ware cleaners,
and glost placers should be subjected
to systematic medical inspection.
In the 1893 report the medical members
of the committee expressed the opinion
that 'many old factories are wholly, or
in part, unfit in a sanitary point of view
for occupation,' and they suggested that
'there should be some authority to
close them, or whatever part of them
is condemned, on the same principle as
dwellings are declared uninhabitable.'
We share this opinion and we concur in
the suggestion. Certain of the factories
we have inspected are in the last stages
of dilapidation, and it appears to us
to be well-nigh impossible to introduce
into them such rearrangements or additions
as are required by the amended
special rules."</p>

<p><b>The Longevity of Animals.</b>&mdash;The
following interesting table, showing the
periods of maturity and the full term of
life of various animals, was prepared by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
E. D. Bell and appeared in Nature for
March 23d. The table was made for
the purpose of demonstrating a constant
relation (in length) between these
two periods of life, which the author
expresses in the following formula, in
which f. t. l. = full term of life, and
p. m. the time required to arrive at
maturity:</p>

<p><b>The Manufacture of Firecrackers
in China.</b>&mdash;There were exported from
China during the year ending June 30,
1897, 26,705,733 pounds of firecrackers,
all from the province of Kwantung.
The exports, however, represent only a
small portion of the number manufactured,
as the use of the cracker is universal
all over China. They are used
at weddings, births, funerals, at festivals,
religious and civil, and in fact
on all occasions out of the ordinary
routine. The United States consul general
at Shanghai gives the following account
of the industry: There are no
large factories; the crackers are made
in small houses and in the shops where
they are sold. In making them only
the cheapest kind of straw paper is used
for the body of the cracker. A little
finer paper is used for the wrapper. A
piece of straw paper, nine by thirty
inches, will make twenty-one crackers
an inch and a half long and a quarter
inch in diameter. The powder is also
of the cheapest grade, and is made in
the locality where used. It costs about
six cents per pound. For the fuse a
paper (called "leather" in Shanghai) is
used, which is imported from Japan,
and is made from the inner lining of
the bamboo. In other places a fine rice
paper is used, generally stiffened slightly
with buckwheat-flour paste, which
the Chinese say adds to its inflammability.
A strip of this paper one third
of an inch wide by fourteen inches (a
Chinese foot) long is laid on a table,
and a very little powder put down the
middle of it with a hollow bamboo stick.
A quick twist of the paper makes the
fuse ready for use. The straw paper is
first rolled by hand around an iron
rod, which varies in size according to
the size of cracker to be made. To
complete the rolling a rude machine is
used. This consists of two uprights
supporting an axis from which is suspended,
by two arms, a heavy piece of
wood, slightly convex on the lower side.
There is just room between this swinging
block and top of the table to place
the cracker. As each layer of paper is
put on by hand, the cracker is placed
on the table and the suspended weight
is drawn over the roll, thus tightening
it until no more can be passed under
the weight. For the smallest "whip"
crackers, the workman uses for compression,
instead of this machine, a
heavy piece of wood fitted with a handle
like that of a carpenter's plane. In filling
crackers, two hundred to three hundred
are tightly tied together in a
bunch; red clay is spread over the end
of the bunch, and forced into the end
of each cracker with a punch. While
the clay is being treated a little water
is sprayed on it, which makes it pack
closer. The powder is poured in at the
other end of the cracker. With the
aid of an awl the edge of the paper is
turned in at the upper end of the
cracker, and the fuse is inserted through
this. The long ends of the fuses are
braided together in such a way that
the crackers lie in two parallel rows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
The braid is doubled on itself, and a
large, quick-firing fuse inserted, and
the whole is bound with a fine thread.
The bundle is wrapped in paper and in
this shape is sent to the seacoast. A
variety of cracker which is very popular
in China is the "twice-sounding"
cracker; it has two chambers, separated
by a plug of clay, through which runs
a connecting fuse. There is also a fuse
extending from the powder in the lower
chamber through the side of the cracker.
When the cracker is to be fired,
it is set on end and fire applied to the
fuse. The powder exploding in the
chamber throws the cracker high in
the air, where the second charge is exploded
by fire from the fuse extending
through the plug between the two
chambers. In the manufacture of these
the clay is first packed in with a punch
to form the separating plug. The
lower chamber is then loaded with powder
and closed by turning over the
paper at the end. The upper chamber
is loaded and closed with clay. A hole
is punched in the side of the lower
chamber with an awl, and the fuse inserted
through this opening.</p>

<p><b>An Enchanted Ravine.</b>&mdash;During
his arch&aelig;ological researches in the Uloa
Valley, Honduras (Memoirs of Peabody
Museum), Mr. George Byron Gordon
made an excursion to the wonderful enchanted
ravine, <i>Quebrada Encantada</i>,
which was famous through all the country
for its weather wisdom. It was
situated in a deep valley, and, Mr. Gordon
says, "sends forth a loud melodious
sound which may be heard many
miles away, and is regarded by the people
of the region as an infallible sign
of rain. In fact, it is a regular weather
bureau, with this peculiarity, that it is
always reliable; for the sound is so
modulated as to indicate by its pitch
whether the coming storm is to be heavy
or light. The amount of promised rain
is in exact proportion to the volume of
the sound, and thus it proclaims to the
accustomed ear with unerring precision
the approach of a passing shower or
heralds the terrific thunderstorm of the
tropics; and this is no fiction, but a
fact, which any one may demonstrate
for himself by going and listening to
it." Tradition says the ravine was the
abode of a golden dragon, and that in
former times "it was lined with golden
pebbles and the sands at its margin
were grains of gold, and it was the
custom of the golden dragon to rise occasionally
to the margin of the pool
and receive the offerings that were
made to him by the people. If they
wanted rain, they would bring their
offerings and lay them on the golden
sand behind the pool or cast them on
the water; then, while all the people
chanted a prayer, the dragon would
rise from the cave where he dwelt in
the depths of the pool, and take the
good things that were offered him, and
there was never a drought or a famine
in the land. Then, when the Spaniards
came and the people were driven from
their homes, the golden pebbles and
grains of gold disappeared, and the
golden dragon, retiring into the uttermost
corner of his watery cavern, withdrew
forever from the upper world.
There he still lives, and, as formerly,
controls the clouds and the winds that
bring the rain. The spirits of the Indians,
too, still hold their meetings of
an occasional evening by their accustomed
pool, now lost in the solitude of
the forest, and it is the sound of their
chanting that makes the voice of the
ravine." The pool is formed by a cataract
tumbling down the side of the
mountain and making a final fall of
fifty feet, and the sound of the tumbling
of the waters forms the basis of the
pretty legend.</p>

<p><b>The Work of the Field Columbian
Museum.</b>&mdash;Making only a selection
from the numerous items of general interest
in the Annual Report of the Director
of the Field Columbian Museum,
Chicago, for 1897-'98, we find mentioned
the fall and spring courses of nine lectures
each, as having been more largely
attended than ever before, hundreds of
persons having been turned away from
some of them, and in one case nearly a
thousand. The library contains 9,003
books and 9,630 pamphlets, and has had
some valuable additions, particularly in
the department of Americana. The additions
to the collections include specimens
from Egypt, Italy (ancient Etruscan
and renaissance Venetian), Portuguese
South Africa, Pacific islands, and
Alaska, the department representing
which now numbers more than ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
thousand objects. Valuable contributions
have been received from the expedition
of the curator of the anthropological
(physical) department to Arizona. The
herbarium of the late Mr. M. S. Bebb,
added to the botanical department, represents
much of the flora of the Western
States, and "about all" that of Illinois.
Numerous other botanical collections
and additions to the geological and
zo&ouml;logical departments are mentioned.
Field work was prosecuted by Mr. G. A.
Dorsey among the Hopi Indians in Arizona,
C. F. Millspaugh in the collection
of North American forest trees, and O. C.
Farrington in the Tertiary geology of
South Dakota, Nebraska, and Wyoming.
Other excursions were made
among the zinc-lead deposits of southeast
Missouri, to the Olympian Mountains
of the Northwest, to "a point beyond
which nothing unless provided
with wings could go," etc., all resulting
in collections of one kind or another.
The museum was visited by 3,963 more
persons than in the year before.</p>

<p><b>A Year at Harvard Observatory.</b>&mdash;The
director of Harvard College Observatory
reports the addition to the resources
of the institution of twenty
thousand dollars bequeathed by Charlotte
Maria Haven, and twenty-five thousand
dollars by Eliza Appleton Haven,
without further restriction in the application
of the income than that it shall
be for direct purposes connected with
astronomical science. In these bequests
the legators fulfilled the wishes of their
brother, Horace Appleton Haven, as expressed
half a century ago. By the peculiar
organization of the force of the observatory,
with a single director to oversee
all and a large force of assistants,
each having a special work and many
of them skillful only in that, an increased
amount of work can be done for
a given expenditure, and great advantages
for co-operation are secured, but
too much depends upon a single person&mdash;the
director. In the examination of
the spectra of stars photographed in the
Draper, Bruce, and Bache telescopes by
Mrs. Fleming, twelve new variable stars
were discovered by means of their bright
hydrogen lines, and the spectra of a considerable
number of other stars were
determined. Valuable results, obtained
by other examiners, are mentioned. An
instrument has been constructed by
which prismatic spectra can be converted
into normal spectra or any other desired
change of scale can be effected. By photographs
obtained of stars in the vicinity
of the north pole material is believed to
be furnished for an accurate determination
of the constants of aberration, nutation,
and precession. Sixteen circulars
were issued during 1897-'98. When fifty
of these circulars have been issued, a
title-page and index are to be published
for binding.</p>

<p><b>Putting Life in the School.</b>&mdash;The
discussion of the hygiene of instruction,
said Dr. G. W. Fitz, in addresses which
are published in the American Physical
Education Review, brings us at once face
to face with one of the gravest problems
of our educational system&mdash;the depressing
effect of school routine. In the
search for a remedy "the school programme
has been pronounced poor, and
efforts have been made to enrich it. The
work has been pronounced abstract and
object lessons have been introduced; uninteresting
and bright colors, varied
shapes, pictures innumerable, have been
rushed upon the child until he has been
bewildered by the multiplicity of detail,
and further exhausted by the demand
for more discriminating attention. The
fundamental difficulty has been that too
much has been required of the child in
the beginning, and the attempt at enrichment
and greater variety has but
increased the burden." Children begin
learning to read before they have acquired
experience and ideas to match the
text; and "experience has shown over
and over again that the child who begins
to read at eight or even ten years of age
is in no wise handicapped in his later intellectual
progress. He has the inestimable
advantage of intense interest,
roused by his growing ability to unlock
the secrets of books and papers after the
fashion of his elders." Writing is taught
before the child has acquired the art of
fine co-ordination, and the effort demanded
in the use of the pen "leads to
a degree of nervous exhaustion unapproached
by any other school work."
In arithmetic the children "are unable
to grasp the numerical relations involved,
and the drill, which makes it a
pure exercise of memory, is necessary.
Much of the aversion to arithmetical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
problems found later is undoubtedly due
to this disheartening primary work.
Here again the child who begins arithmetic
at eight or ten years of age finds
himself able to take it up quickly and
has the liking for it that easy mastery
always gives." Nature work, on the
other hand, "offers wonderfully interesting
and valuable material for awakening
the intellectual activities of childhood,
and while its material for study and description
is unlimited, its demand upon
the child may be perfectly adapted to
his power of observation. We must remember
that physical activity is the supreme
factor in the development of the
child." This means spontaneous play
under favorable conditions, not "that
nervously exhausting and deadening
drill known as the Swedish gymnastics,
which ... adds fatigue to fatigue, by
taking the initiative away from the child
and forcing him to pay constant attention
to the orders of the teacher." As to
discipline, "the child is self-disciplined
when he is held to his work by the reflex
attention of interest. This can always
be secured when the work is adapted to
his grasp, when he has the sense of power
which comes with easy conquest, when
he is not exhausted by the imposition of
a sequence logical to the adult mind but
meaningless to him, when his attention
is not dulled by a demand for attention
continued beyond a physiological limit."</p>

<p><b>Beautifying the Home Grounds.</b>&mdash;The
Horticultural Division of the Cornell
University Agricultural Experiment
Station has been making efforts during
the past few years, under the auspices of
the agricultural extension work, to improve
the surroundings of rural houses,
a part of which consists in the publication
of bulletins giving hints as to how
improved conditions and simple adornments
may be obtained without great expense.
One of these indicates as one of
the means of making the home attractive
and "keeping the boy on the farm"
the brightening of the place with flowers.
Assuming that the main planting of
any place should be of trees and shrubs,
the flowers are then used as decorations.
They may be thrown in freely about the
borders of the place, but not in beds in
the center of the lawn. They show off
better when seen against a background,
which may be foliage, a building, a rock,
or a fence. "Where to plant flowers is
really more important than what to
plant. In front of bushes, in the corner
by the steps, against the foundation of
the residence or outhouse, along a fence
or walk&mdash;these are places for flowers. A
single petunia plant against a background
of foliage is worth a dozen similar
plants in the center of the lawn....
The open-centered yard may be a picture;
the promiscuously planted yard
may be a nursery or a forest. A little
color scattered in here and there puts a
finish to the picture. A dash of color
gives spirit and character to the brook
or pond, to the ledge of rocks, to the old
stump, or to the pile of rubbish." The
flower garden, if there is one, should be
at one side of the residence or at the
rear, "for it is not allowable to spoil a
good lawn even with flowers."</p>


<h3>MINOR PARAGRAPHS.</h3>

<p>Of the twelve genera and fifty species
of known North American frogs
and toads, Mr. William L. Sherwood
says, in his paper in the Proceedings of
the Linn&aelig;an Society, New York, that
five genera and fifty species are found
in the vicinity of New York city. Some
of these are less secretive in habit than
salamanders, and therefore much better
known. As ponds and ditches have
been drained, the aquatic forms have
removed to greater distances from human
dwellings, and only the more terrestrial
toad and arboreal tree frogs
have remained. All of our species have
been described, but the author believes
that the first mention of the cricket
frog being found in this region is in a
paper on salamanders, read by him in
1895. The breeding habits of these animals
vary, but all lay their eggs in
water or moist places. The purely amphibious
and really aquatic species are
three. Of the other eight species, one
is burrowing, five tend to be terrestrial,
inhabiting the woods and fields, and
two are arboreal. The eggs are laid in
gelatinous envelopes, which swell after
leaving the adult. At the time of hatching
the young tadpole has three pairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
of external gills, but no mouth or anal
opening. Two small suckers, just back
of where the mouth is to appear, enable
it to cling to aquatic plants and prevent
its dropping to the bottom of the pond
and getting smothered in the mud. It
soon develops into a tadpole, and proceeds
to its development; but if prevented
from coming to the surface of
the water no metamorphosis takes
place, and the changes are delayed by
cold and dark.</p>

<p>At a meeting recently held in Berlin
in behalf of a German antarctic exploration,
Dr. von Drygalski, speaking
of the scientific, practical, and national
importance of the enterprise, said that
from a geographical point of view the
fundamental problem attached to the
south polar region&mdash;the verification or
disproof of a polar continent&mdash;is still unsolved.
No less important questions
likewise await solution with respect to
the geological structure and character
of the southern lands&mdash;so important in
connection with a knowledge of volcanic
action and the supposed former
connection of South America and Australia&mdash;and
with respect to the conditions
of inland ice. Even the study of the
floating ice broken away from the main
mass may lead to important conclusions
as to its mode of origin and the nature
of the land from which it comes. Other
problems to be investigated are the origin
of the cold ocean currents that take
their rise in the south, the conditions of
the atmospheric pressure and temperature
in that region, and the questions relating
to terrestrial magnetism, which
have a very important bearing on the
practice of navigation. The present
seems to be a particularly favorable period
for the resumption of south polar research
by reason of the unusual amount
of drift ice which has within the last few
years broken away from the main mass,
and because, according to Supan, we are
passing through a warmer temperature
period.</p>

<p>Over and above the statistics and
the bare record of facts the annual reports
of the Perkins Institution and
Massachusetts School for the Blind afford
a continuous and growing interest
to friends of suffering mankind in their
stories of the development of mental life
and illumination. Pupils come there
blind and deaf, and apparently without
any avenues of intelligent communication
with the outer world, and are there
brought to full consciousness and keenness
of intellect that would be remarked
even in many persons possessed of all
their senses perfect from birth. The record
began with Laura Bridgman, was
continued with Helen Keller, and has
been occupied for five or six years past
with the wonderful mental growth of
Elizabeth Robin, Edith M. Thomas, and
Tommy Stringer. Before Dr. Howe began
with Laura Bridgman, such things
would have been deemed impossible and
not to be thought of.</p>


<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>The Swiss Association for the Protection
of Plants, which was formed in
Geneva in 1883, has more than 900 members,
and publishes 1,500 copies of its
bulletin, which is sent, besides the members
of the association, to the libraries
of foreign Alpine clubs, the press, botanists,
<i>cur&eacute;s</i>, and municipalities in
countries harboring plants that require
protection. Under its care, or the influence
of its work, gardens have been
created in various places and devoted
especially to the cultivation of such
plants as are most threatened with extinction.
Of these are the Linnea Garden
in the Valais, 5,500 feet above the
sea; the Chanousia, founded five years
ago by R. P. Chanoux, rector of the
Hospice of St. Bernard, 6,800 feet; and
the Rambertia, at the foot of the
Rochers de Naye, 6,500 feet above the
Lake of Geneva. Lectures are given
under the auspices of the association,
and no occasion for informing the public
is lost. A neat chromo-poster calling
attention to the association and its
purpose has been prepared to be put up
in railroad stations and hotels, to which
is appended a motto emphasizing the
importance of caring for rare plants.</p>

<p>The report of Heinrich Ries on the
Kaolins and Fire Clays of Europe, published
in the reports of the Geological
Survey, is based largely on notes collected
by the author during visits in
1897 to most of the important kaolin
and clay deposits. To these such facts
of importance concerning the clays as
have already been published have been
added. Some manufacturers have
claimed that the foreign kaolins are
superior to the American, but the evidence,
Mr. Ries says, does not seem to
bear out the statements. Notes are
added respecting the clays and clay-working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
industries in the States of Alabama,
Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, New
York, and North Carolina.</p>

<p>According to the report of the <i>Commission
Internationale des Glaciers</i> for
1897, thirty-nine out of fifty-six glaciers
observed in Switzerland are retreating,
five are at a standstill, and
twelve are growing. Of the Italian glaciers,
those of the Disgrazia and Bernina
groups and the glaciers of Mont
Canin in the Julian Alps show a marked
retreat. Retreat seems to be almost
universal in the Scandinavian glaciers.
The report includes also information
from the Caucasus, Altai, and Turkestan,
and notes on a few glaciers in the
United States and Mexico, concerning
which we have not the particulars.</p>

<p>In a book on social types among
the French people, M. Edmond Demolins
tries to show that varieties of types
are the products of constant causes
which it is possible to analyze exactly,
and the most fundamental principle of
which is the nature of the place and of
the occupation. Thus there is a social
type derived from the pastoral occupation;
another from the cultivation of
fruit trees, among which the several
classes determine as many modalities of
the type; one is derived from petty gardening,
and another from large farming;
another from manufacturing, and
another from transportation and commerce.
Close analysis permits the detection
of still more delicate shades of
types of varieties in each of the categories
named, whereby notable modifications
are produced in the same region
and the same work.</p>

<p>The brewing industry in Germany
is credited with the following output of
beer for the year 1897-'98: Germany
proper, 8,055 breweries, exclusive of Bavaria,
W&uuml;rtemberg, Baden, and Alsace-Lorraine,
916,000,000 gallons; Bavaria,
6,364 breweries, 351,000,000 gallons;
W&uuml;rtemberg, 6,285 breweries, 90,000,000
gallons; Baden, 946 breweries, 60,000,000
gallons; Alsace-Lorraine, 127 breweries,
21,230,000 gallons&mdash;a grand total
of 1,438,230,000 gallons, from the taxation
of which the Government received
a revenue of $22,305,150.</p>

<p>Speaking in his society of the Relation
of Britain to Folklore, retiring
President Alfred Nutt urged that it
was the privilege of that country to
enshrine in its literature the ancient
customary wisdom of many races, as
the English system of law was itself
largely derived from custom. The accidents
of the geographical position
and historical circumstances of Britain
had made it the preserver of a great
body of archaic tradition, which it was
the function of the Folklore Society to
study and interpret.</p>
